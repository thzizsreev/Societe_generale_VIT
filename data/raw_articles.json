        "content": "The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned a North Korean front company and three associated individuals for their involvement in the fraudulent remote information technology (IT) worker scheme designed to generate illicit revenues for Pyongyang.\n\nThe sanctions target Korea Sobaeksu Trading Company (aka Sobaeksu United Corporation), and Kim Se Un, Jo Kyong Hun, and Myong Chol Min for evading sanctions imposed by the U.S. and the United Nations against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) government.\n\n\"Our commitment is clear: Treasury, as part of a whole-of-government effort, will continue to hold accountable those who seek to infiltrate global supply chains and enable the sanctions evasion activities that further the Kim regime's destabilizing agenda,\" said Director of OFAC Bradley T. Smith.\n\nThe latest action marks the U.S. government's continued efforts to dismantle North Korea's wide-ranging revenue generation schemes and fund its illegal nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\n\nThe IT worker scheme, which has mutated into a global threat, entails the DPRK regime dispatching highly skilled IT workers to various locations, including China, Russia, and Vietnam, to obtain remote jobs and infiltrate U.S. companies and elsewhere using a combination of fraudulent documents, stolen identities, and false personas, often with help from facilitators who run laptop farms.\n\nIn what has been described as a recurring, if \"baffling,\" theme, many of these fake workers have been found to use Minions and other Despicable Me characters in social-media profiles and email addresses.\n\n\"The DPRK government withholds most of the wages earned by IT workers, generating hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue to support the North Korean regime's unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs,\" the Treasury said. \"In some cases, these DPRK IT workers have introduced malware into company networks to exfiltrate proprietary and sensitive data.\"\n\nThe development comes merely weeks after OFAC sanctioned Song Kum Hyok, a 38-year-old member of a North Korean hacking group called Andariel, for their role in the IT worker scheme.\n\nIn related news, Christina Marie Chapman, 50, of Arizona, was sentenced to 8.5 years in prison for running a laptop farm for IT workers to give the impression that they were working remotely within the U.S. when, in reality, they were logging into those machines remotely. Chapman pleaded guilty earlier this February.\n\nThe impacted companies included a top-five major television network, a Silicon Valley technology company, an aerospace manufacturer, an American car maker, a luxury retail store, and a U.S. media and entertainment company. The IT workers also unsuccessfully attempted to land jobs at two different U.S. government agencies.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) seized more than 90 laptops from Chapman's home during an October 2023 raid. Chapman is also said to have 49 laptops at locations overseas, including multiple shipments to a Chinese city on the North Korean border.\n\nIn all, the elaborate counterfeit operation netted more than $17 million in illicit revenue for Chapman and North Korea from October 2020 to October 2023. Chapman has also been ordered to serve three years of supervised release, to forfeit $284,556 that was to be paid to the North Koreans, and to pay a judgment of $176,850.\n\n\"Christina Chapman perpetrated a years' long scheme that resulted in millions of dollars raised for the DPRK regime, exploited more than 300 American companies and government agencies, and stole dozens of identities of American citizens,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti of the Justice Department's Criminal Division.",

        "link": "https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/patchwork-targets-turkish-defense-firms.html",
        "content": "The threat actor known as Patchwork has been attributed to a new spear-phishing campaign targeting Turkish defense contractors with the goal of gathering strategic intelligence.\n\n\"The campaign employs a five-stage execution chain delivered via malicious LNK files disguised as conference invitations sent to targets interested in learning more about unmanned vehicle systems,\" Arctic Wolf Labs said in a technical report published this week.\n\nThe activity, which also singled out an unnamed manufacturer of precision-guided missile systems, appears to be geopolitically motivated as the timing coincides amid deepening defense cooperation between Pakistan and T\u00fcrkiye, and the recent India-Pakistan military skirmishes.\n\nPatchwork, also called APT-C-09, APT-Q-36, Chinastrats, Dropping Elephant, Operation Hangover, Quilted Tiger, and Zinc Emerson, is assessed to be a state-sponsored actor of Indian origin. Known to be active since at least 2009, the hacking group has a track record of striking entities in China, Pakistan, and other countries in South Asia.\n\nExactly a year ago, the Knownsec 404 Team documented Patchwork's targeting entities with ties to Bhutan to deliver the Brute Ratel C4 framework and an updated version of a backdoor called PGoShell.\n\nSince the start of 2025, the threat actor has been linked to various campaigns aimed at Chinese universities, with recent attacks using baits related to power grids in the country to deliver a Rust-based loader that, in turn, decrypts and launches a C# trojan called Protego to harvest a wide range of information from compromised Windows systems.\n\nAnother report published by Chinese cybersecurity firm QiAnXin back in May said it identified infrastructure overlaps between Patchwork and DoNot Team (aka APT-Q-38 or Bellyworm), suggesting potential operational connections between the two threat clusters.\n\nThe targeting of T\u00fcrkiye by the hacking group points to an expansion of its targeting footprint, using malicious Windows shortcut (LNK) files distributed via phishing emails as a starting point to kick-off the multi-stage infection process.\n\nSpecifically, the LNK file is designed to invoke PowerShell commands that are responsible for fetching additional payloads from an external server (\"expouav[.]org\"), a domain created on June 25, 2025, that hosts a PDF lure mimicking an international conference on unmanned vehicle systems, details of which are hosted on the legitimate waset[.]org website.\n\n\"The PDF document serves as a visual decoy, designed to distract the user while the rest of the execution chain runs silently in the background,\" Arctic Wolf said. \"This targeting occurs as T\u00fcrkiye commands 65% of the global UAV export market and develops critical hypersonic missile capabilities, while simultaneously strengthening defense ties with Pakistan during a period of heightened India-Pakistan tensions.\"\n\nAmong the downloaded artifacts is a malicious DLL that's launched using DLL side-loading by means of a scheduled task, ultimately leading to the execution of shellcode that carries out extensive reconnaissance of the compromised host, including taking screenshots, and exfiltrating the details back to the server.\n\n\"This represents a significant evolution of this threat actor's capabilities, transitioning from the x64 DLL variants observed in November 2024, to the current x86 PE executables with enhanced command structures,\" the company said. \"Dropping Elephant demonstrates continued operational investment and development through architectural diversification from x64 DLL to x86 PE formats, and enhanced C2 protocol implementation through impersonation of legitimate websites.\"",

        "link": "https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/cyber-espionage-campaign-hits-russian.html",
        "content": "Russian aerospace and defense industries have become the target of a cyber espionage campaign that delivers a backdoor called EAGLET to facilitate data exfiltration.\n\nThe activity, dubbed Operation CargoTalon, has been assigned to a threat cluster tracked as UNG0901 (short for Unknown Group 901).\n\n\"The campaign is aimed at targeting employees of Voronezh Aircraft Production Association (VASO), one of the major aircraft production entities in Russia via using \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e-\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f (TTN) documents \u2014 critical to Russian logistics operations,\" Seqrite Labs researcher Subhajeet Singha said in an analysis published this week.\n\nThe attack commences with a spear-phishing email bearing cargo delivery-themed lures that contain a ZIP archive, within which is a Windows shortcut (LNK) file that uses PowerShell to display a decoy Microsoft Excel document, while also deploying the EAGLET DLL implant on the host.\n\nThe decoy document, per Seqrite, references Obltransterminal, a Russian railway container terminal operator that was sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in February 2024.\n\nEAGLET is designed to gather system information and establish a connection to a hard-coded remote server (\"185.225.17[.]104\") in order to process the HTTP response from the server and extract the commands to be executed on the compromised Windows machine.\n\nThe implant supports shell access and the ability to upload/download files, although the exact nature of the next-stage payloads delivered through this method is unknown, given that the command-and-control (C2) server is currently offline.\n\nSeqrite said it also uncovered similar campaigns targeting the Russian military sector with EAGLET, not to mention source code and targeting overlaps with another threat cluster tracked as Head Mare that's known to target Russian entities.\n\nThis includes the functional parallels between EAGLET and PhantomDL, a Go-based backdoor with a shell and file download/upload feature, as well as the similarities in the naming scheme used for the phishing message attachments.\n\nThe disclosure comes as the Russian state-sponsored hacking group called UAC-0184 (aka Hive0156) has been attributed to a fresh attack wave targeting victims in Ukraine with Remcos RAT as recently as this month.\n\nWhile the threat actor has a history of delivering Remcos RAT since early 2024, newly spotted attack chains distributing the malware have been simplified, employing weaponized LNK or PowerShell files to retrieve the decoy file and the Hijack Loader (aka IDAT Loader) payload, which then launches Remcos RAT.\n\n\"Hive0156 delivers weaponized Microsoft LNK and PowerShell files, leading to the download and execution of Remcos RAT,\" IBM X-Force said, adding it \"observed key decoy documents featuring themes that suggest a focus on the Ukrainian military and evolving to a potential wider audience.\"",

        "link": "https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/soco404-and-koske-malware-target-cloud.html",
        "content": "Threat hunters have disclosed two different malware campaigns that have targeted vulnerabilities and misconfigurations across cloud environments to deliver cryptocurrency miners.\n\nThe threat activity clusters have been codenamed Soco404 and Koske by cloud security firms Wiz and Aqua, respectively.\n\nSoco404 \"targets both Linux and Windows systems, deploying platform-specific malware,\" Wiz researchers Maor Dokhanian, Shahar Dorfman, and Avigayil Mechtinger said. \"They use process masquerading to disguise malicious activity as legitimate system processes.\"\n\nThe activity is a reference to the fact that payloads are embedded in fake 404 HTML pages hosted on websites built using Google Sites. The bogus sites have since been taken down by Google.\n\nWiz posited that the campaign, which has been previously observed going after Apache Tomcat services with weak credentials, as well as susceptible Apache Struts and Atlassian Confluence servers using the Sysrv botnet, is part of a broader crypto-scam infrastructure, including fraudulent cryptocurrency trading platforms.\n\nThe latest campaign has also been found to target publicly-accessible PostgreSQL instances, with the attackers also abusing compromised Apache Tomcat servers to host payloads tailored for both Linux and Windows environments. Also hacked by the attackers is a legitimate Korean transportation website for malware delivery.\n\nOnce initial access is obtained, PostgreSQL's COPY ... FROM PROGRAM SQL command is exploited to run arbitrary shell commands on the host and achieve remote code execution.\n\n\"The attacker behind Soco404 appears to be conducting automated scans for exposed services, aiming to exploit any accessible entry point,\" Wiz said. \"Their use of a wide range of ingress tools, including Linux utilities like wget and curl, as well as Windows-native tools such as certutil and PowerShell, highlights an opportunistic strategy.\"\n\nOn Linux systems, a dropper shell script is executed directly in memory to download and launch a next-stage payload, while simultaneously taking steps to terminate competing miners to maximize financial gain and limit forensic visibility by overwriting logs associated with cron and wtmp.\n\nThe payload executed in the next-stage is a binary that serves as a loader for the miner by contacting an external domain (\"www.fastsoco[.]top\") that's based on Google Sites.\n\nThe attack chain for Windows leverages the initial post-exploitation command to download and execute a Windows binary, which, like its Linux counterpart, functions akin to a loader that embeds both the miner and the WinRing0.sys driver, the latter being used to obtain NT\\SYSTEM privileges.\n\nOn top of that, the malware attempts to stop the Windows event log service and executes a self-deletion command to evade detection.\n\n\"Rather than relying on a single method or operating system, the attacker casts a wide net, deploying whichever tool or technique is available in the environment to deliver their payload,\" the company said. \"This flexible approach is characteristic of a broad, automated cryptomining campaign focused on maximizing reach and persistence across varied targets.\"\n\nThe discovery of Soco404 dovetails with the emergence of a new Linux threat dubbed Koske that's suspected to be developed with assistance from a large language model (LLM) and uses seemingly innocuous images of pandas to propagate the malware.\n\nThe attack starts with the exploitation of a misconfigured server, such as JupyterLab, to install various scripts from two JPEG images, including a C-based rootkit that's used to hide malicious malware-related files using LD_PRELOAD and a shell script that ultimately downloads cryptocurrency miners on the infected system. Both payloads are directly executed in memory to avoid leaving traces on disk.\n\nKoske's end goal is to deploy CPU and GPU-optimized cryptocurrency miners that take advantage of the host's computational resources to mine 18 distinct coins, such as Monero, Ravencoin, Zano, Nexa, and Tari, among others.\n\n\"These images are polyglot files, with malicious payloads appended to the end. Once downloaded, the malware extracts and executes the malicious segments in memory, bypassing antivirus tools,\" Aqua researcher Assaf Morag said.\n\n\"This technique isn't steganography but rather polyglot file abuse or malicious file embedding. This technique uses a valid JPG file with malicious shellcode hidden at the end. Only the last bytes are downloaded and executed, making it a sneaky form of polyglot abuse.\"",

        "link": "https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/overcoming-risks-from-chinese-genai.html",
        "content": "A recent analysis of enterprise data suggests that generative AI tools developed in China are being used extensively by employees in the US and UK, often without oversight or approval from security teams. The study, conducted by Harmonic Security, also identifies hundreds of instances in which sensitive data was uploaded to platforms hosted in China, raising concerns over compliance, data residency, and commercial confidentiality.\n\nOver a 30-day period, Harmonic examined the activity of a sample of 14,000 employees across a range of companies. Nearly 8 percent were found to have used China-based GenAI tools, including DeepSeek, Kimi Moonshot, Baidu Chat, Qwen (from Alibaba), and Manus. These applications, while powerful and easy to access, typically provide little information on how uploaded data is handled, stored, or reused.\n\nThe findings underline a widening gap between AI adoption and governance, especially in developer-heavy organizations where time-to-output often trumps policy compliance.\n\nIf you're looking for a way to enforce your AI usage policy with granular controls, contact Harmonic Security.\n\nData Leakage at Scale\n\nIn total, over 17 megabytes of content were uploaded to these platforms by 1,059 users. Harmonic identified 535 separate incidents involving sensitive information. Nearly one-third of that material consisted of source code or engineering documentation. The remainder included documents related to mergers and acquisitions, financial reports, personally identifiable information, legal contracts, and customer records.\n\nHarmonic's study singled out DeepSeek as the most prevalent tool, associated with 85 percent of recorded incidents. Kimi Moonshot and Qwen are also seeing uptake. Collectively, these services are reshaping how GenAI appears inside corporate networks. It's not through sanctioned platforms, but through quiet, user-led adoption.\n\nChinese GenAI services frequently operate under permissive or opaque data policies. In some cases, platform terms allow uploaded content to be used for further model training. The implications are substantial for firms operating in regulated sectors or handling proprietary software and internal business plans.\n\nPolicy Enforcement Through Technical Controls\n\nHarmonic Security has developed tools to help enterprises regain control over how GenAI is used in the workplace. Its platform monitors AI activity in real time and enforces policy at the moment of use.\n\nCompanies have granular controls to block access to certain applications based on their HQ location, restrict specific types of data from being uploaded, and educate users through contextual prompts.\n\nGovernance as a Strategic Imperative\n\nThe rise of unauthorized GenAI use inside enterprises is no longer hypothetical. Harmonic's data show that nearly one in twelve employees is already interacting with Chinese GenAI platforms, often with no awareness of data retention risks or jurisdictional exposure.\n\nThe findings suggest that awareness alone is insufficient. Firms will require active, enforced controls if they are to enable GenAI adoption without compromising compliance or security. As the technology matures, the ability to govern its use may prove just as consequential as the performance of the models themselves.\n\nHarmonic makes it possible to embrace the benefits of GenAI without exposing your business to unnecessary risk.\n\nLearn more about how Harmonic helps enforce AI policies and protect sensitive data at harmonic.security.",

        "link": "https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/fire-ant-exploits-vmware-flaw-to.html",
        "content": "Virtualization and networking infrastructure have been targeted by a threat actor codenamed Fire Ant as part of a prolonged cyber espionage campaign.\n\nThe activity, observed this year, is primarily designed Now to infiltrate organizations' VMware ESXi and vCenter environments as well as network appliances, Sygnia said in a new report published today.\n\n\"The threat actor leveraged combinations of sophisticated and stealthy techniques creating multilayered attack kill chains to facilitate access to restricted and segmented network assets within presumed to be isolated environments,\" the cybersecurity company said.\n\n\"The attacker demonstrated a high degree of persistence and operational maneuverability, operating through eradication efforts, adapting in real time to eradication and containment actions to maintain access to the compromise infrastructure.\"\n\nFire Ant is assessed to share tooling and targeting overlaps with prior campaigns orchestrated by UNC3886, a China-nexus cyber espionage group known for its persistent targeting of edge devices and virtualization technologies since at least 2022.\n\nAttacks mounted by the threat actor have been found to establish entrenched control of VMware ESXi hosts and vCenter servers, demonstrating advanced capabilities to pivot into guest environments and bypass network segmentation by compromising network appliances.\n\nAnother noteworthy aspect is the ability of the threat actor to maintain operational resilience by adapting to containment efforts, switching to different tools, dropping fallback backdoors for persistence, and altering network configurations to re-establish access to compromised networks.\n\nFire Ant's breach of the virtualization management layer is achieved by the exploitation of CVE-2023-34048, a known security flaw in VMware vCenter Server that has been exploited by UNC3886 as a zero-day for years prior to it being patched by Broadcom in October 2023.\n\n\"From vCenter, they extracted the 'vpxuser' service account credentials and used them to access connected ESXi hosts,\" Sygnia noted. \"They deployed multiple persistent backdoors on both ESXi hosts and the vCenter to maintain access across reboots. The backdoor filename, hash, and deployment technique aligned the VIRTUALPITA malware family.\"\n\nAlso dropped is a Python-based implant (\"autobackup.bin\") that provides remote command execution, and file download and upload capabilities. It runs in the background as a daemon.\n\nUpon gaining unauthorized access to the hypervisor, the attackers are said to have leveraged another flaw in VMware Tools (CVE-2023-20867) to interact directly with guest virtual machines via PowerCLI, as well as interfered with the functioning of security tools and extracted credentials from memory snapshots, including that of domain controllers.\n\nSome of the other crucial aspects of the threat actor's tradecraft are as follows -\n\nDropping V2Ray framework to facilitate guest network tunneling\n\nDeploying unregistered virtual machines directly on multiple ESXi hosts\n\nBreaking down network segmentation barriers by exploiting CVE-2022-1388 to compromise F5 load balancers and establishing cross-segments persistence by deploying web shells\n\nResist incident response and remediation efforts by re-compromising assets and, in some cases, blend in by renaming their payloads to impersonate forensic tools\n\nThe attack chain ultimately opened up a pathway for Fire Ant to maintain persistent, covert access from the hypervisor to guest operating systems. Sygnia also described the adversary as possessing a \"deep understanding\" of the target environment's network architecture and policies in order to reach otherwise isolated assets.\n\nFire Ant is unusually focused on remaining undetected and leaves a minimal intrusion footprint. This is evidenced in the steps taken by the attackers to tamper with logging on ESXi hosts by terminating the \"vmsyslogd\" process, effectively suppressing an audit trail and limiting forensic visibility.\n\nThe findings underscore a worrying trend involving the persistent and successful targeting of network edge devices by threat actors, particularly those from China, in recent years.\n\n\"This campaign underscores the importance of visibility and detection within the hypervisor and infrastructure layer, where traditional endpoint security tools are ineffective,\" Sygnia said.\n\n\"Fire Ant consistently targeted infrastructure systems such as ESXi hosts, vCenter servers, and F5 load balancers. The targeted systems are rarely integrated into standard detection and response programs. These assets lack detection and response solutions and generate limited telemetry, making them ideal long-term footholds for stealthy operation.\"\n\nThe development comes a week after Singapore pointed fingers at UNC3886 for carrying out cyber attacks targeting local critical infrastructure that delivers essential services. The government offered no further details.\n\n\"UNC3886 poses a serious threat to us, and has the potential to undermine our national security,\" Coordinating Minister for National Security, K. Shanmugam, said in a speech. \"It is going after high value strategic threat targets, vital infrastructure that delivers essential services.\"\n\nIn a Facebook post, the Chinese embassy in Singapore said such claims were \"groundless smears and accusations,\" and that the information systems of 9th Asian Winter Games were subjected to over 270,000 cyber attacks from abroad earlier this February.\n\n\"In addition to the recent context of the attribution disclosed by Singapore's minister of national security, we can highlight that the group's activity poses risks to critical infrastructure that extend beyond the regional borders of Singapore and the APJ region,\" Yoav Mazor, Head of Incident Response at Sygnia, told The Hacker News.\n\n(The story was updated after publication to include a response from Sygnia.)",

        "link": "https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/castleloader-malware-infects-469.html",
        "content": "Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on a new versatile malware loader called CastleLoader that has been put to use in campaigns distributing various information stealers and remote access trojans (RATs).\n\nThe activity employs Cloudflare-themed ClickFix phishing attacks and fake GitHub repositories opened under the names of legitimate applications, Swiss cybersecurity company PRODAFT said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\n\nThe malware loader, first observed in the wild earlier this year, has been used to distribute DeerStealer, RedLine, StealC, NetSupport RAT, SectopRAT, and even other loaders like Hijack Loader.\n\n\"It employs dead code injection and packing techniques to hinder analysis,\" the company said. \"After unpacking itself at runtime, it connects to a C2 (command-and-control) server, downloads target modules, and executes them.\"\n\nCastleLoader's modular structure allows it to act as both a delivery mechanism and a staging utility, enabling threat actors to separate initial infection from payload deployment. This separation complicates attribution and response because it decouples the infection vector from the eventual malware behavior, giving attackers more flexibility in adapting campaigns over time.\n\nCastleLoader payloads are distributed as portable executables containing an embedded shellcode, which then invokes the main module of the loader that, in turn, connects to the C2 server in order to fetch and execute the next-stage malware.\n\nAttacks distributing the malware have relied on the prevalent ClickFix technique on domains posing as software development libraries, videoconferencing platforms, browser update notifications, or document verification systems, ultimately tricking users into copying and executing PowerShell commands that activate the infection chain.\n\nVictims are directed to the bogus domains through Google searches, at which point they are served pages containing fake error messages and CAPTCHA verification boxes developed by the threat actors, asking them to carry out a series of instructions to supposedly address the issue.\n\nAlternatively, CastleLoader leverages fake GitHub repositories mimicking legitimate tools as a distribution vector, causing users who unknowingly download them to compromise their machines with malware instead.\n\n\"This technique exploits developers' trust in GitHub and their tendency to run installation commands from repositories that appear reputable,\" PRODAFT said.\n\nThis strategic abuse of social engineering mirrors techniques used in initial access brokers (IABs), underscoring its role within a broader cybercrime supply chain.\n\nPRODAFT said it has observed Hijack Loader being delivered via DeerStealer as well as CastleLoader, with the latter also propagating DeerStealer variants. This suggests the overlapping nature of these campaigns, despite them being orchestrated by different threat actors.\n\nSince May 2025, CastleLoader campaigns have leveraged seven distinct C2 servers, with over 1,634 infection attempts recorded during the time period. Analysis of its C2 infrastructure and its web-based panel\u2014which is used to oversee and manage the infections \u2013 shows that as many as 469 devices were compromised, resulting in an infection rate of 28.7%.\n\nResearchers also observed elements of anti-sandboxing and obfuscation\u2014features typical in advanced loaders like SmokeLoader or IceID. Combined with PowerShell abuse, GitHub impersonation, and dynamic unpacking, CastleLoader reflects a growing trend in stealth-first malware loaders that operate as stagers in malware-as-a-service (MaaS) ecosystems.\n\n\"Castle Loader is a new and active threat, rapidly adopted by various malicious campaigns to deploy an array of other loaders and stealers,\" PRODAFT said. \"Its sophisticated anti-analysis techniques and multi-stage infection process highlight its effectiveness as a primary distribution mechanism in the current threat landscape.\"\n\n\"The C2 panel demonstrates operational capabilities typically associated with malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offerings, suggesting the operators have experience in cybercriminal infrastructure development.\"",

Today, it\u2019s about battling a massive, financially motivated cybercrime industry. Attacks are smarter, faster, and more damaging\u2014and that changes everything for product teams.\n\nFor product managers (PMs), this means understanding that attackers are constantly exploiting the same weak spots: stolen admin credentials, missing multi-factor authentication (MFA) on VPNs, remote encryption, and clever \u201cliving off the land\u201d (LOTL) tricks like using Office to launch PowerShell.\n\nEven something as simple as an unpatched firewall or a rogue USB drive can open the door to a breach.\n\nNew vulnerabilities and zero-days are popping up all the time, and product teams have to stay on their toes.

Follina (MSDT): Let Office apps launch PowerShell without any user interaction.\n\nTimely patching helps, but it\u2019s not enough. There\u2019s always a gap between discovering a flaw and fixing it. That\u2019s why teams need layered defenses and a mindset that\u2019s ready to respond to incidents as they happen.\n\nHow breach reports drive real-time product shifts\n\nThe 100 days to secure your environment webinar series from ThreatLocker is a great example of incident-driven development. It helps security leaders focus on what matters most in their first few months.\n\nReal-world breaches often directly lead to new product features or policy changes.

Features now include IP-based access controls or even disabling unused VPNs.\n\nThe PM's response: From advisory to actionable feature\n\nFor cybersecurity PMs, reacting to threats means more than just writing advisories. It\u2019s about building smarter, safer products. Here\u2019s how:\n\nGet full visibility\n\nStart by understanding what\u2019s running in your environment. Use monitoring agents to track file activity, privilege changes, app launches, and network traffic. Prioritize risks\n\nWith a complete picture, PMs can focus on high-risk tools and behaviors: Remote access tools like TeamViewer or AnyDesk\n\nSoftware with too many permissions (e.g., 7-Zip, Nmap)\n\nRisky browser extensions\n\nSoftware from high-risk regions Drive adaptive policy creation\n\nSecurity policies should evolve with the threat landscape: Test first: Use monitor-only mode and test groups before enforcing new rules.\n\nBe precise: Go beyond on/off switches\u2014use dynamic ACLs, Ringfencing, and app-specific admin rights.\n\nEncourage adoption by minimizing disruption Offer a store of pre-approved apps Make it easy to request new software Explain why restrictions exist\u2014it builds trust\n\nContinuous improvement and monitoring: Use health reports to spot misconfigurations Block USB file copies if thresholds are exceeded Clean up old policies and unused apps regularly\n\nEmbrace patch management\n\nMake sure everything\u2014from operating systems to portable applications like PuTTY\u2014is up to date.

        "content": "The U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has sanctioned three North Korean nationals and a company for supporting fraudulent IT worker schemes that generated illicit revenue for the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK) government.\n\nThe sanctioned company is named Korea Sobaeksu Trading Company, and the three North Korean individuals are Kim Se Un, Jo Kyong Hun, and Myong Chol Min.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s IT worker schemes involve placing skilled tech workers in American companies using fake or stolen identities to get the job.\n\nThe workers' earnings are then funneled to the DPRK regime to fund its nuclear and missile programs.\n\nIn a recent public service announcement, the FBI has updated its recommendations for U.S. businesses to defend against such schemes.\n\nThe U.S. has taken decisive action against these schemes and their facilitators in the past, such as the disruption of \u201claptop farm\u201d operations in the country earlier this month and the indictment of 14 key individuals.\n\nAlso earlier this month, OFAC sanctioned Song Kum Hyok, believed to be a member of the North Korean hacking group \u201cAndariel\u201d and a facilitator of IT worker schemes.\n\nOFAC's latest round of sanctions lists the following entities and individuals that played a role in financial facilitation, recruitment, and cryptocurrency operations aimed to further DPRK's goals:\n\nKorea Sobaeksu Trading Company \u2013 A North Korea-based front company for the Munitions Industry Department that sends IT workers overseas and procures materials for DPRK\u2019s nuclear and missile programs. Kim Se Un \u2013 A Sobaeksu representative who ran subordinate companies, recruited North Korean IT workers abroad (e.g., in Vietnam), and supported revenue generation efforts. Jo Kyong Hun \u2013 An IT team leader at Sobaeksu involved in managing cryptocurrency and financial operations linked to DPRK's IT projects. Myong Chol Min \u2013 A trade representative who helped Sobaeksu evade sanctions and attempted to import goods like tobacco to generate revenue for the regime.\n\nOFAC's sanctions translate into freezing assets on U.S. territory and prohibiting transactions with U.S. persons and businesses. Overall increased international pressure is another effect of the sanctions.\n\nSanctions are not the only means to disrupt DPRK's efforts as the U.S. Department of State has announced rewards of up to $7 million for information leading to the arrest/conviction of the sanctioned individuals.",

While they initially used encryptors from other gangs (such as ALPHV/BlackCat), they deployed their own Zeon encryptor soon after and rebranded as Royal ransomware in September 2022.\n\nIn June 2023, after targeting the City of Dallas, Texas, the Royal ransomware gang began working under the BlackSuit name, following the testing of a new encryptor called BlackSuit amid rumors of a rebranding.\n\nCISA and the FBI first revealed in a November 2023 joint advisory that Royal and BlackSuit share similar tactics, while their encryptors exhibit obvious coding overlaps. The same advisory linked the Royal ransomware gang to attacks targeting over 350 organizations worldwide since September 2022, resulting in ransom demands exceeding $275 million.\n\nThe two agencies confirmed in August 2024 that the Royal ransomware had rebranded as BlackSuit and had demanded over $500 million from victims since surfacing more than two years prior.\n\nUpdate 7/24/25: Updated article to include that negotiation sites were seized as well.",

        "content": "A new Linux malware named Koske may have been developed with artificial intelligence and is using seemingly benign JPEG images of panda bears to deploy malware directly into system memory.\n\nResearchers from cybersecurity company AquaSec analyzed Koske and described it as \"a sophhisticated Linux threat.\" Based on the observed adaptive behavior, the researchers believe that the malware was developed using large language models (LLMs) or automation frameworks.\n\nKoske\u2019s purpose is to deploy CPU and GPU-optimized cryptocurrency miners that use the host\u2019s computational resources to mine over 18 distinct coins.\n\nAquaSec identified Serbia-based IP addresses used in the attacks, Serbian phrases in the scripts, and Slovak language in the GitHub repository hosting the miners, but it could make no confident attribution.\n\nPandas attack\n\nInitial access is achieved by leveraging misconfigurations of JupyterLab instances exposed online to achieve command execution.\n\nAfter gaining a foothold, the attacker downloads two .JPEG images of panda bears hosted on legitimate services like OVH images, freeimage, and postimage. However, the pictures hide malicious payloads.\n\nAquaSec underlines that the threat actor did not use steganography to hide the malware inside images but relied on polyglot files, which are valid in multiple formats.\n\nIn Koske attacks, the same file can be interpreted as both an image and a script, depending on the application that opens or processes it.\n\nWhile the panda pics feature valid image headers for the JPEG format, they also include malicious shell scripts and C code at the end, allowing both formats to be interepreted separately.\n\nA user opening them will see a cute panda bear but a script interpreter will execute the shell code appended at the end of the file.\n\nSeemingly innocuous panda image (top), file contents (bottom)\n\nSource: AquaSec\n\nThe attacks AquaSec discovered hide one payload in each image, both launched in parallel.\n\n\u201cOne payload is C code written directly to memory, compiled, and executed as a shared object .so file that functions as a rootkit,\u201d explains AquaSec.\n\n\u201cThe second is a shell script, also executed from memory, which uses standard system utilities to run stealthily and maintain persistence while leaving few visible traces.\u201d\n\nThe shell script is executed directly in memory by abusing native Linux utilities, establishing persistence via cron jobs that run every 30 minutes, and custom systemd services.\n\nIt also performs network hardening and proxy evasion, overwriting /etc/resolv.conf to use Cloudflare and Google DNS, locking it using the chattr +i command, flushing iptables, resetting proxy variables, and using a custom module to brute-force working proxies via curl, wget, and raw TCP checks.\n\nThis type of adaptability and behavior is what led AquaSec researchers to suspect that the threat actor developed the malware either with the help of a LLM or an automation platform.\n\nThe C-based rootkit is compiled in memory and uses LD_PRELOAD to override the readdir() function, hiding malware-related processes, files, and directories from user-space monitoring tools.\n\nThe rootkit filters entries based on strings like koske, hideproc, or by reading hidden PIDs from /dev/shm/.hiddenpid.\n\nAfter establishing network access and setting up persistence, the shell script downloads cryptominers from GitHub.\n\nComplete attack chain\n\nSource: AquaSec\n\nBefore deployment, the host\u2019s CPU and GPU are evaluated to determine which miner would be the most efficient choice.\n\nKoske supports mining for 18 different coins, including the hard-to-trace Monero, Ravencoin, Zano, Nexa, and Tari.\n\nIf a coin or mining pool becomes unavailable, the malware automatically switches to a backup from its internal list, indicating a high degree of automation and adaptability.\n\nAquaSec warns that while AI-powered malware like Koske is already concerning, future variants may leverage real-time adaptability, evolving into a far more dangerous class of threats.",

The file uses PowerShell (\u2018worker.ps1\u2019) to fetch the main payload from soft-gets[.]com.\n\nFickle Stealer is an info-stealer that harvests data stored in web browsers, such as account credentials, auto-fill information, cookies, and cryptocurrency wallet data.\n\nEncryptHub used the same malware in a massive spear-phishing and social engineering campaign last year, which compromised over six hundred organizations worldwide.\n\nThe threat actor is a peculiar case in the cybercrime space as they are linked to both malicious exploitation of Windows zero-day vulnerabilities and responsible disclosures of critical flaws to Microsoft.\n\n\u201cThe compromised executable appears legitimate to users downloading from Steam, creating an effective social engineering component that relies on platform trust rather than traditional deception techniques,\u201d reads the report Prodaft shared with BleepingComputer.\n\n\u201cWhen users click on the Playtest of this game, which they find in the free games, they are actually downloading malicious software,\u201d the researchers say.\n\nOverview of the EncryptHub attack\n\nSource: Prodaft\n\nProdaft explains that the malware is running in the background and does not impact gameplay performance, leaving gamers clueless of the compromise.\n\nIt is unclear how EncryptHub managed to add the malicious files to the game project but one explanation could be an insider helping out. The developer of the game has not published any official statements on their game's Steam page or on social media.\n\nBleepingComputer has contacted both Chemia and Valve with a request for comments and we will update this post when we receive a response.\n\nMeanwhile, the game remains available on Steam, and it is unclear if the latest version is clean of malware or still dangerous to download. Until official announcements are made from Steam, it would be better to avoid it entirely.\n\nThis is the third case of malware slipping into Steam this year. The previous ones were \u2018Sniper: Phantom\u2019s Resolution\u2019 in March, and \u2018PirateFi\u2019 in February.\n\nIn all three cases, the titles were early access games and not stable releases, which may indicate more lax reviewing procedures from Steam on such titles. That said, caution is advised when downloading \u201cwork-in-progress\u201d titles.\n\nIndicators of compromise for this latest EncryptHub attack are available here.",

The breach was discovered on August 17, 2022.\n\n\u201cOn July 21, 2022, Nelnet Servicing, LLC (Nelnet), our servicing system and customer website\n\nportal provider, notified us that they had discovered a vulnerability that we believe led to this incident,\u201d according to the Nelnet.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what the vulnerability was.\n\n\u201cOn August 17, 2022, this investigation determined that certain student loan account registration information was accessible by an unknown party beginning in June 2022 and ending on July 22, 2022,\u201d according to the letter.\n\nLoan Recipient Targets\n\nAlthough users\u2019 most sensitive financial data was protected, the personal information that was accessed in the Nelnet breach \u201chas potential to be leveraged in future social engineering and phishing campaigns,\u201d explained Melissa Bischoping, endpoint security research specialist at Tanium, in a statement via email.\n\n\u201cWith recent news of student loan forgiveness, it\u2019s reasonable to expect the occasion to be used by scammers as a gateway for criminal activity,\u201d Bischoping said.\n\nLast week, the Biden administration announced a plan to cancel $10,000 of student loan debt for low- and middle-income loanees. She said the loan forgiveness program will be used to lure victims into opening up phishing emails.\n\nShe warns that recently breached data will be used to impersonate affected brands in waves of phishing campaigns targeting students and recent college graduates.\n\n\u201cBecause they can leverage the trust from existing business relationships they can be particularly deceptive,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAccording to the breach disclosure Nelnet Servicing informed Edfinancial and OSLA that Nelnet Servicing\u2019s cybersecurity team \u201ctook immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity.\u201d\n\nRemediation also included two years of free credit monitoring, credit reports and up to $1 million in identity theft insurance.",

        "content": "Researchers uncover a watering hole attack likely carried out by APT TA423, which attempts to plant the ScanBox JavaScript-based reconnaissance tool.\n\nA China-based threat actor has ramped up efforts to distribute the ScanBox reconnaissance framework to victims that include domestic Australian organizations and offshore energy firms in the South China Sea. The bait used by the advanced threat group (APT) is targeted messages that supposedly link back to Australian news websites.\n\nThe cyber-espionage campaigns are believed to have launched April 2022 through mid-June 2022, according to a Tuesday report by Proofpoint\u2019s Threat Research Team and PwC\u2019s Threat Intelligence team.\n\nThe threat actor, according to researchers, is believed to be the China-based APT TA423, also known as Red Ladon. \u201cProofpoint assesses with moderate confidence that this activity may be attributable to the threat actor TA423 / Red Ladon, which multiple reports assess to operate out of Hainan Island, China,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThe APT is most recently known for a recent indictment. \u201cA 2021 indictment by the US Department of Justice assessed that TA423 / Red Ladon provides long-running support to the Hainan Province Ministry of State Security (MSS),\u201d researchers said.\n\nMSS is the civilian intelligence, security and cyber police agency for the People\u2019s Republic of China. It is believed responsible for counter-intelligence, foreign intelligence, political security and tied to industrial and cyber espionage efforts by China.\n\nDusting Off the ScanBox\n\nThe campaign leverages the ScanBox framework. ScanBox is a customizable and multifunctional Javascript-based framework used by adversaries to conducting covert reconnaissance.\n\nScanBox has been used by adversaries for nearly a decade and is noteworthy because criminals can use the tool to conduct counter intelligence without having to plant malware on a targets system.\n\n\u201cScanBox is particularly dangerous as it doesn\u2019t require malware to be successfully deployed to disk in order to steal information \u2013 the keylogging functionality simply requires the JavaScript code to be executed by a web browser,\u201d according to PwC researchers referring to a previous campaign.\n\nIn lieu of malware, attackers can use ScanBox in conjunction with watering hole attacks. Adversaries load the malicious JavaScript onto a compromised website where the ScanBox acts as a keylogger snagging all of a user\u2019s typed activity on the infected watering hole website.\n\nTA423\u2019s attacks began with phishing emails, with such titles as \u201cSick Leave,\u201d \u201cUser Research\u201d and \u201cRequest Cooperation.\u201d Often, the emails purported to come from an employee of the \u201cAustralian Morning News,\u201d a fictional organization. The employee implored targets to visit their \u201chumble news website,\u201d australianmorningnews[.]com.\n\n\u201cUpon clicking the link and redirecting to the site, visitors were served the ScanBox framework,\u201d researchers wrote.\n\nThe link directed targets to a web page with content copied from actual news sites, like the BBC and Sky News. In the process, it also delivered the ScanBox malware framework.\n\nScanBox keylogger data culled from waterholes is part of a multi-stage attack, giving attackers insight into the potential targets that will help them launch future attacks against them. This technique is often called browser fingerprinting.\n\nThe primary, initial script sources a list of information about the target computer, including the operating system, language and version of Adobe Flash installed. ScanBox additionally runs a check for browser extensions, plugins and components such WebRTC.\n\n\u201cThe module implements WebRTC, a free and open-source technology supported on all major browsers, which allows web browsers and mobile applications to perform real-time communication (RTC) over application programming interfaces (APIs). This allows ScanBox to connect to a set of pre-configured targets,\u201d researchers explain.\n\nAdversaries can then leverage a technology called STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT). This is a standardized set of methods, including a network protocol, that allows interactive communications (including real-time voice, video, and messaging applications) to traverse network address translator (NAT) gateways, researchers explain.\n\n\u201cSTUN is supported by the WebRTC protocol. Through a third-party STUN server located on the Internet, it allows hosts to discover the presence of a NAT, and to discover the mapped IP address and port number that the NAT has allocated for the application\u2019s User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows to remote hosts. ScanBox implements NAT traversal using STUN servers as part of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), a peer-to-peer communication method used for clients to communicate as directly as possible, avoiding having to communicate through NATs, firewalls, or other solutions,\u201d according to researchers.\n\n\u201cThis means that the ScanBox module can set up ICE communications to STUN servers, and communicate with victim machines even if they are behind NAT,\u201d they explain.\n\nThreat Actors\n\nThe threat actors \u201csupport the Chinese government in matters related to the South China Sea, including during the recent tensions in Taiwan,\u201d Sherrod DeGrippo, vice president of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, explained in a statement, \u201cThis group specifically wants to know who is active in the region and, while we can\u2019t say for certain, their focus on naval issues is likely to remain a constant priority in places like Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Australia.\u201d\n\nThe group has, in the past, expanded well beyond Australasia. According to a Department of Justice indictment from July, 2021, the group has \u201cstolen trade secrets and confidential business information\u201d from victims in \u201cthe United States, Austria, Cambodia, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Targeted industries included, among others, aviation, defense, education, government, health care, biopharmaceutical and maritime.\u201d\n\nDespite the DoJ indictment, analysts \u201chave not observed a distinct disruption of operational tempo\u201d from TA423, and they \u201ccollectively expect TA423 / Red Ladon to continue pursuing its intelligence-gathering and espionage mission.\u201d",

        "content": "Targeted attacks on Twilio and Cloudflare employees are tied to a massive phishing campaign that resulted in 9,931 accounts at over 130 organizations being compromised. The campaigns are tied to focused abuse of identity and access management firm Okta, which gained the threat actors the 0ktapus moniker, by researchers.\n\n\u201cThe primary goal of the threat actors was to obtain Okta identity credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes from users of the targeted organizations,\u201d wrote Group-IB researchers in a recent report. \u201cThese users received text messages containing links to phishing sites that mimicked the Okta authentication page of their organization.\u201d\n\nImpacted were 114 US-based firms, with additional victims of sprinkled across 68 additional countries.\n\nRoberto Martinez, senior threat intelligence analyst at Group-IB, said the scope of the attacks is still an unknown. \u201cThe 0ktapus campaign has been incredibly successful, and the full scale of it may not be known for some time,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat the 0ktapus Hackers Wanted\n\nThe 0ktapus attackers are believed to have begun their campaign by targeting telecommunications companies in hopes of winning access to potential targets\u2019 phone numbers.\n\nWhile unsure exactly how threat actors obtained a list of phone numbers used in MFA-related attacks, one theory researchers posit is that 0ktapus attackers began their campaign targeting telecommunications companies.\n\n\u201c[A]ccording to the compromised data analyzed by Group-IB, the threat actors started their attacks by targeting mobile operators and telecommunications companies and could have collected the numbers from those initial attacks,\u201d researchers wrote.\n\nNext, attackers sent phishing links to targets via text messages. Those links led to webpages mimicking the Okta authentication page used by the target\u2019s employer. Victims were then asked to submit Okta identity credentials in addition to a multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes employees used to secure their logins.\n\nIn an accompanying technical blog, researchers at Group-IB explain that the initial compromises of mostly software-as-a-service firms were a phase-one in a multi-pronged attack. 0ktapus\u2019 ultimate goal was to access company mailing lists or customer-facing systems in hopes of facilitating supply-chain attacks.\n\nIn a possible related incident, within hours of Group-IB publishing its report late last week, the firm DoorDash revealed it was targeted in an attack with all the hallmarks of an 0ktapus-style attack.\n\nBlast Radius: MFA Attacks\n\nIn a blog post DoorDash revealed; \u201cunauthorized party used the stolen credentials of vendor employees to gain access to some of our internal tools.\u201d The attackers, according to the post, went on to steal personal information \u2013 including names, phone numbers, email and delivery addresses \u2013 from customers and delivery people.\n\nIn the course of its campaign, the attacker compromised 5,441 MFA codes, Group-IB reported.\n\n\u201cSecurity measures such as MFA can appear secure\u2026 but it is clear that attackers can overcome them with relatively simple tools,\u201d researchers wrote.\n\n\u201cThis is yet another phishing attack showing how easy it is for adversaries to bypass supposedly secure multifactor authentication,\u201d Roger Grimes, data-driven defense evangelist at KnowBe4, wrote in a statement via email. \u201cIt simply does no good to move users from easily phish-able passwords to easily phish-able MFA. It\u2019s a lot of hard work, resources, time, and money, not to get any benefit.\u201d\n\nTo mitigate 0ktapus-style campaigns, the researchers recommended good hygiene around URLs and passwords, and using FIDO2-compliant security keys for MFA.\n\n\u201cWhatever MFA someone uses,\u201d Grimes advised, \u201cthe user should be taught about the common types of attacks that are committed against their form of MFA, how to recognize those attacks, and how to respond. We do the same when we tell users to pick passwords but don\u2019t when we tell them to use supposedly more secure MFA.\u201d",

        "content": "Lockbit is by far this summer\u2019s most prolific ransomware group, trailed by two offshoots of the Conti group.\n\nAfter a recent dip, ransomware attacks are back on the rise. According to data released by NCC Group, the resurgence is being led by old ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) groups.\n\nWith data gathered by \u201cactively monitoring the leak sites used by each ransomware group and scraping victim details as they are released,\u201d researchers have determined that Lockbit was by far the most prolific ransomware gang in July, behind 62 attacks. That\u2019s ten more than the month prior, and more than twice as many as the second and third most prolific groups combined. \u201cLockbit 3.0 maintain their foothold as the most threatening ransomware group,\u201d the authors wrote, \u201cand one with which all organizations should aim to be aware of.\u201d\n\nThose second and third most prolific groups are Hiveleaks \u2013 27 attacks \u2013 and BlackBasta \u2013 24 attacks. These figures represent rapid rises for each group \u2013 since June, a 440 percent rise for Hiveleaks, and a 50 percent rise for BlackBasta.\n\nIt may well be that the resurgence in ransomware attacks, and the rise of these two particular groups, are intimately connected.\n\nWhy Ransomware Has Bounced\n\nResearchers from NCC Group counted 198 successful ransomware campaigns in July \u2013 up 47 percent from June. Sharp as that incline may be, it still falls some ways short of the high-water mark set this Spring, with nearly 300 such campaigns in both March and April.\n\nWhy the Flux?\n\nWell, in May, the United States government ramped up its efforts against Russian cybercrime by offering up to $15 million for prized information about Conti, then the world\u2019s foremost ransomware gang. \u201cIt is likely that the threat actors that were undergoing structural changes,\u201d the authors of the report speculated, \u201cand have begun settling into their new modes of operating, resulting in their total compromises increasing in conjunction.\u201d\n\nHiveleaks and BlackBasta are the result of that restructuring. Both groups are \u201cassociated with Conti,\u201d the authors noted, Hiveleaks as an affiliate and BlackBasta as a replacement strain. \u201cAs such, it appears that it has not taken long for Conti\u2019s presence to filter back into the threat landscape, albeit under a new identity.\u201d\n\nNow that Conti\u2019s properly split in two, the authors speculated, \u201cit would not be surprising to see these figures further increase as we move into August.\u201d",

        "content": "New research indicates that over 80,000 Hikvision surveillance cameras in the world today are vulnerable to an 11 month-old command injection flaw.\n\nHikvision \u2013 short for Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology \u2013 is a Chinese state-owned manufacturer of video surveillance equipment. Their customers span over 100 countries (including the United States, despite the FCC labeling Hikvision \u201can unacceptable risk to U.S. national security\u201d in 2019).\n\nLast Fall, a command injection flaw in Hikvision cameras was revealed to the world as CVE-2021-36260. The exploit was given a \u201ccritical\u201d 9.8 out of 10 rating by NIST.\n\nDespite the severity of the vulnerability, and nearly a year into this story, over 80,000 affected devices remain unpatched. In the time since, the researchers have discovered \u201cmultiple instances of hackers looking to collaborate on exploiting Hikvision cameras using the command injection vulnerability,\u201d specifically in Russian dark web forums, where leaked credentials have been put up for sale.\n\nThe extent of the damage done already is unclear. The authors of the report could only speculate that \u201cChinese threat groups such as MISSION2025/APT41, APT10 and its affiliates, as well as unknown Russian threat actor groups could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in these devices to fulfill their motives (which may include specific geo-political considerations).\u201d\n\nThe Risk in IoT Devices\n\nWith stories like this, it\u2019s easy to ascribe laziness to individuals and organizations that leave their software unpatched. But the story isn\u2019t always so simple.\n\nAccording to David Maynor, senior director of threat intelligence at Cybrary, Hikvision cameras have been vulnerable for many reasons, and for a while. \u201cTheir product contains easy to exploit systemic vulnerabilities or worse, uses default credentials. There is no good way to perform forensics or verify that an attacker has been excised. Furthermore, we have not observed any change in Hikvision\u2019s posture to signal an increase in security within their development cycle.\u201d\n\nA lot of the problem is endemic to the industry, not just Hikvision. \u201cIoT devices like cameras aren\u2019t always as easy or straightforward to secure as an app on your phone,\u201d Paul Bischoff, privacy advocate with Comparitech, wrote in a statement via email. \u201cUpdates are not automatic; users need to manually download and install them, and many users might never get the message. Furthermore, IoT devices might not give users any indication that they\u2019re unsecured or out of date. Whereas your phone will alert you when an update is available and likely install it automatically the next time you reboot, IoT devices do not offer such conveniences.\u201d\n\nWhile users are none the wiser, cybercriminals can scan for their vulnerable devices with search engines like Shodan or Censys. The problem can certainly be compounded with laziness, as Bischoff noted, \u201cby the fact that Hikvision cameras come with one of a few predetermined passwords out of the box, and many users don\u2019t change these default passwords.\u201d\n\nBetween weak security, insufficient visibility and oversight, it\u2019s unclear when or if these tens of thousands of cameras will ever be secured.",

        "content": "Twitter is blasted for security and privacy lapses by the company\u2019s former head of security who alleges the social media giant\u2019s actions amount to a national security risk.\n\nA recently surfaced 84-page whistleblower report filed with the US government by Twitter\u2019s former head of security Peiter \u201cMudge\u201d Zatko last month blasts his former employer for its alleged shoddy security practices and being out of compliance with an FTC order to protect user data.\n\nTwitter has responded alleging that Zatko is a \u201cdisgruntled employee\u201d who was fired for poor performance and leadership. In a letter to employees Twitter\u2019s CEO Parag Agrawal asserts that Zatko\u2019s claims are a \u201cfalse narrative that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies, and presented without important context.\u201d\n\nHere is an abbreviated overview of the allegations and Twitter\u2019s reaction.\n\nAllegations\n\nZatko, a respected white-hat hacker who served as Twitter\u2019s head of security for roughly 15 months between 2020 and 2022, accused Twitter of a litany of poor security and privacy practices that together constituted a national security risk.\n\nTop accusations include:\n\nTwitter is a mismanaged company and gives too many of its staff access to sensitive security and privacy controls without adequate oversight.\n\nOne or more Twitter employees may be working for undisclosed foreign intelligence services. This, according to Zatko, elevates his concerns to a matter of national security.\n\nNearly half of Twitter\u2019s servers lack basic security features, such as data encryption, because software running on them is either outdated or unpatched.\n\nTwitter executives have prioritized growth over security as they have personally pursued massive bonuses, as high as $10 million, as incentives for the company\u2019s rapid expansion.\n\nThe company is out of compliance with a 2010 FTC order to protect users\u2019 personal information. Additionally, the company has lied to independent auditors of an FTC mandated \u201ccomprehensive information security program\u201d tied to the 2010 order.\n\nTwitter does not honor user requests to delete their personal data, because of technical limitations.\n\nWhen Zatko attempted to bring these and many other security and privacy issues to Twitter\u2019s board, company management misrepresented his finding and/or tried to hide the report.\n\nTwitter allowed some foreign governments \u201c\u2026 to infiltrate, control, exploit, surveil and/or censor the \u2018company\u2019s platform, staff, and operations,\u201d according to the redacted whistleblower report submitted to congress.\n\nTwitter does not have the resources or capacity to accurately determine the true number of fake (or bot) accounts on its platform. This question is central to a Elon Musk\u2019s attempt to back out of buying the company for $44 billion.\n\nTwitter\u2019s Muted Response\n\nThe thrust of Twitter\u2019s response to Zatko is that he is a disgruntled employee, bad at his job and scapegoating Twitter for his failures. It points out that it has addressed and continues to aggressively address many of the IT security issues pointed out by Zatko.\n\nAn alleged response by Twitter\u2019s CEO Parag Agrawal sent internally to Twitter employees was posted online.\n\nNEW: First time Twitter CEO @paraga weighs in on whistleblower story. Sending this message to staff this morning. pic.twitter.com/WY4TCqbA5q \u2014 Donie O'Sullivan (@donie) August 23, 2022\n\nMeanwhile top Democrats and Republicans in Congress have reacted by promising to investigate the claims. Sen. Richard Durbin (D-IL), chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, confirmed he was investigating the whistleblower disclosure.",

The DoS attack would appear to originate from a Palo Alto Networks PA-Series (hardware), VM-Series (virtual) and CN-Series (container) firewall against an attacker-specified target.\u201d\n\nThe advisory describes the non-standard configuration at risk as the \u201cfirewall configuration must have a URL filtering profile with one or more blocked categories assigned to a security rule with a source zone that has an external facing network interface.\u201d\n\nThe configuration is likely unintended by the network administrator, the advisory said.\n\nCISA Adds Bug to KEV Catalog\n\nOn Monday, CISA added the Palo Alto Networks bug to its list of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog.\n\nThe CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog is a curated list of flaws that have been exploited in the wild. It is also a list of KEVs that the agency \u201cstrongly recommends\u201d public and private organizations pay close attention to in order to \u201cprioritize remediation\u201d to \u201creduce the likelihood of compromise by known threat actors.\u201d\n\nReflective and Amplification DoS Attacks\n\nOne of the most notable evolutions in the DDoS landscape is the growth in the peak size of volumetric attacks. Attackers continue to use reflection/amplification techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in DNS, NTP, SSDP, CLDAP, Chargen and other protocols to maximize the scale of their attacks.\n\nReflected and amplified denial-of-service attacks are not new and have steadily become more common over the years.\n\nDistributed denial of service attacks, bent on taking websites offline by overwhelming domains or specific application infrastructure with massive traffic flows, continue to pose a major challenge to businesses of all stripes. Being knocked offline impacts revenue, customer service and basic business functions \u2013 and worryingly, the bad actors behind these attacks are honing their approaches to become ever more successful over time.\n\nUnlike limited volume DDoS attacks, reflective and amplified DoS attacks can produce much higher volumes of disruptive traffic. This type of attack allows an adversary to magnify the amount of malicious traffic they generate while obscuring the sources of the attack traffic. An HTTP-based DDoS attack, for example, sends junk HTTP requests to a target\u2019s server tying up resources and locking out users from using a particular site or service.\n\nA TCP attack, believed used in the recent Palo Alto Networks attack, is when an attacker sends a spoofed SYN packet, with the original source IP replaced by the victim\u2019s IP address, to a range of random or pre-selected reflection IP addresses. The services at the reflection addresses reply with a SYN-ACK packet to the victim of the spoofed attack. If the victim does not respond, the reflection service will continue to retransmit the SYN-ACK packet, resulting in amplification. The amount of amplification depends on the number of SYN-ACK retransmits by the reflection service, which can be defined by the attacker.",

        "content": "Fake travel reservations are exacting more pain from the travel weary, already dealing with the misery of canceled flights and overbooked hotels.\n\nA longtime threat group identified as TA558 has ramped up efforts to target the travel and hospitality industries. After a lull in activity, believed tied to COVID-related travel restrictions, the threat group has ramped up campaigns to exploit an uptick in travel and related airline and hotel bookings.\n\nWarnings come from security researchers who say TA558 cybercriminals have revamped their 2018 campaigns with fake reservation emails that contain links \u2013 that if clicked \u2013 deliver a malicious malware payload containing a potpourri of malware variants.\n\nWhat makes this most recent campaign unique, according to a report by Proofpoint, is the use of RAR and ISO file attachments linked to messages. ISO and RAR are single compressed files, that if executed, decompress the file and folder data inside of them.\n\n\u201cTA558 began using URLs more frequently in 2022. TA558 conducted 27 campaigns with URLs in 2022, compared to just five campaigns total from 2018 through 2021. Typically, URLs led to container files such as ISOs or zip [RAR] files containing executables,\u201d Proofpoint wrote.\n\nTo become infected, the targeted victim would have to be tricked into decompressing the file archive. \u201cThe reservation link\u2026 led to an ISO file and an embedded batch file. The execution of the BAT file led to a PowerShell helper script that downloaded a follow-on payload, AsyncRAT,\u201d researchers wrote.\n\nUpgrade Your Itinerary To Malware Infection Status\n\nPast TA558 campaigns, tracked by Palo Alto Networks (in 2018), Cisco Talos (in 2020 and 2021) and Uptycs (in 2020), have leveraged malicious Microsoft Word document attachments (CVE-2017-11882) or remote template URLs to download and install malware, according to Proofpoint.\n\nThe shift to ISO and RAR files \u201cis likely due to Microsoft\u2019s announcements in late 2021 and early 2022 about disabling macros [VBA and XL4] by default in Office products,\u201d researchers said.\n\n\u201cIn 2022, campaign tempo increased significantly. Campaigns delivered a mixture of malware such as, Loda, Revenge RAT, and AsyncRAT. This actor used a variety of delivery mechanisms including URLs, RAR attachments, ISO attachments, and Office documents,\u201d researchers wrote.\n\nMalware payloads of recent campaigns typically include remote access trojans (RATs), that can enable reconnaissance, data theft and distribution of follow-on payloads, Proofpoint said.\n\nThrough all their evolutions, though, the goal of the group has always remained the same. The analysts concluded \u201cwith medium to high confidence\u201d that TA558 is financially motivated, using stolen data to scale up and steal money. \u201cIts possible compromises could impact both organizations in the travel industry as well as potentially customers who have used them for vacations,\u201d Sherrod DeGrippo, vice president of threat research and detection organizations at Proofpoint, wrote in a statement. \u201cOrganizations in these and related industries should be aware of this actor\u2019s activities and take precautions to protect themselves.\u201d\n\nTA558\u2019s History\n\nSince at least 2018, TA558 has primarily targeted organizations in the fields of travel, hospitality, and related industries. Those organizations tend to be located in Latin America, and sometimes in North America or Western Europe.\n\nThroughout their history, TA558 has used socially engineered emails to lure victims into clicking on malicious links or documents. Those emails \u2013 most often written in Portuguese or Spanish \u2013 usually purported to concern hotel reservations. The subject line, or the name of the attached document, was often, simply, \u201creserva.\u201d\n\nIn their early exploits, the group would leverage vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word\u2019s Equation Editor \u2013 for example, CVE-2017-11882, a remote code execution bug. The goal was to download a RAT \u2013 most commonly Loda or Revenge RAT \u2013 to the target machine.\n\nIn 2019 the group expanded its arsenal, with malicious macro-laced Powerpoint attachments and template injections against Office documents. They also expanded to new demographics, utilizing English-language phishing lures for the first time.\n\nEarly 2020 was TA558\u2019s most prolific period, as they churned out 25 malicious campaigns in January alone. They predominantly used macro-laden Office documents, or targeted known Office vulnerabilities during this period.\n\n\u201cOrganizations, especially those operating in targeted sectors in Latin America, North America, and Western Europe should be aware of this actor\u2019s tactics, techniques, and procedures,\u201d researchers advise.",

        "content": "Separate fixes to macOS and iOS patch respective flaws in the kernel and WebKit that can allow threat actors to take over devices and are under attack.\n\nApple is urging macOS, iPhone and iPad users immediately to install respective updates this week that includes fixes for two zero-days under active attack. The patches are for vulnerabilities that allow attackers to execute arbitrary code and ultimately take over devices.\n\nPatches are available for effected devices running iOS 15.6.1 and macOS Monterey 12.5.1. Patches address two flaws, which basically impact any Apple device that can run either iOS 15 or the Monterey version of its desktop OS, according to security updates released by Apple Wednesday.\n\nOne of the flaws is a kernel bug (CVE-2022-32894), which is present both in iOS and macOS. According to Apple it is an \u201cout-of-bounds write issue [that] was addressed with improved bounds checking.\u201d\n\nThe vulnerability allows an application to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges, according to Apple, which, in usual vague fashion, said there is a report that it \u201cmay have been actively exploited.\u201d\n\nThe second flaw is identified as a WebKit bug (tracked as CVE-2022-32893), which is an out-of-bounds write issue that Apple addressed with improved bounds checking. The flaw allows for processing maliciously crafted web content that can lead to code execution, and also has been reported to be under active exploit, according to Apple. WebKit is the browser engine that powers Safari and all other third-party browsers that work on iOS.\n\nPegasus-Like Scenario\n\nThe discovery of both flaws, about which little more beyond Apple\u2019s disclosure are known, was credited to an anonymous researcher.\n\nOne expert expressed worry that the latest Apple flaws \u201ccould effectively give attackers full access to device,\u201d they might create a Pegasus-like scenario similar to the one in which nation-state APTs barraged targets with spyware made by Israeli NSO Group by exploiting an iPhone vulnerability.\n\n\u201cFor most folks: update software by end of day,\u201d tweeted Rachel Tobac, the CEO of SocialProof Security, regarding the zero-days. \u201cIf threat model is elevated (journalist, activist, targeted by nation states, etc): update now,\u201d Tobac warned.\n\nZero-Days Abound\n\nThe flaws were unveiled alongside other news from Google this week that it was patching its fifth zero-day so far this year for its Chrome browser, an arbitrary code execution bug under active attack.\n\nThe news of yet more vulnerabilities from top tech vendors being barraged by threat actors demonstrates that despite the best efforts from top-tier tech companies to address perennial security issues in their software, it remains an uphill battle, noted Andrew Whaley, senior technical director at Promon, a Norwegian app security company.\n\nThe flaws in iOS are especially worrying, given the ubiquity of iPhones and users\u2019 utter reliance on mobile devices for their daily lives, he said. However, the onus is not only on vendors to protect these devices but also for users to be more aware of existing threats, Whaley observed.\n\n\u201cWhile we all rely on our mobile devices, they are not invulnerable, and as users we need to maintain our guard just like we do on desktop operating systems,\u201d he said in an email to Threatpost.\n\nAt the same time, developers of apps for iPhones and other mobile devices also should add an extra layer of security controls in their technology so they are less reliant on OS security for protection, given the flaws that frequently crop up, Whaley observed.\n\n\u201cOur experience shows that this is not happening enough, potentially leaving banking and other customers vulnerable,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "An insufficient validation input flaw, one of 11 patched in an update this week, could allow for arbitrary code execution and is under active attack.\n\nGoogle has patched the fifth actively exploited zero-day vulnerability discovered in Chrome this year as one in a series of fixes included in a stable channel update released Wednesday.\n\nThe bug, tracked as CVE-2022-2856 and rated as high on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), is associated with \u201cinsufficient validation of untrusted input in Intents,\u201d according to the advisory posted by Google.\n\nGoogle credits Ashley Shen and Christian Resell of its Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) for reporting the zero-day bug, which could allow for arbitrary code execution, on July 19. The advisory also unveiled 10 other patches for various other Chrome issues.\n\nIntents are a deep linking feature on the Android device within the Chrome browser that replaced URI schemes, which previously handled this process, according to Branch, a company that offers various linking options for mobile applications.\n\n\u201cInstead of assigning window.location or an iframe.src to the URI scheme, in Chrome, developers need to use their intent string as defined in this document,\u201d the company explained on its website. Intent \u201cadds complexity\u201d but \u201cautomatically handles the case of the mobile app not being installed\u201d within links, according to the post.\n\nInsufficient validation is associated with input validation, a frequently-used technique for checking potentially dangerous inputs to ensure that they are safe for processing within the code, or when communicating with other components, according to MITRE\u2019s Common Weakness Enumeration site.\n\n\u201cWhen software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application,\u201d according to a post on the site. \u201cThis will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.\u201d\n\nFending Off Exploits\n\nAs is typical, Google did not disclose specific details of the bug until it is widely patched to avoid threat actors taking further advantage of it, a strategy that one security professional noted is a wise one.\n\n\u201cPublicizing details on an actively exploited zero-day vulnerability just as a patch becomes available could have dire consequences, because it takes time to roll out security updates to vulnerable systems and attackers are champing at the bit to exploit these types of flaws,\u201d observed Satnam Narang, senior staff research engineer at cybersecurity firm Tenable, in an email to Threatpost.\n\nHolding back info is also sound given that other Linux distributions and browsers, such as Microsoft Edge, also include code based on Google\u2019s Chromium Project. These all could be affected if an exploit for a vulnerability is released, he said.\n\n\u201cIt is extremely valuable for defenders to have that buffer,\u201d Narang added.\n\nWhile the majority of the fixes in the update are for vulnerabilities rated as high or medium risk, Google did patch a critical bug tracked as CVE-2022-2852, a use-after-free issue in FedCM reported by Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero on Aug. 8. FedCM\u2014short for the Federated Credential Management API\u2013provides a use-case-specific abstraction for federated identity flows on the web, according to Google.\n\nFifth Chrome 0Day Patch So Far\n\nThe zero-day patch is the fifth Chrome bug under active attack that Google has patched so far this year.\n\nIn July, the company fixed an actively exploited heap buffer overflow flaw tracked as CVE-2022-2294 in WebRTC, the engine that gives Chrome its real-time communications capability, while in May it was a separate buffer overflow flaw tracked as CVE-2022-2294 and under active attack that got slapped with a patch.\n\nIn April, Google patched CVE-2022-1364, a type confusion flaw affecting Chrome\u2019s use of the V8 JavaScript engine on which attackers already had pounced. The previous month a separate type-confusion issue in V8 tracked as CVE-2022-1096 and under active attack also spurred a hasty patch.\n\nFebruary saw a fix for the first of this year\u2019s Chrome zero-days, a use-after-free flaw in Chrome\u2019s Animation component tracked as CVE-2022-0609 that already was under attack. Later it was revealed that North Korean hackers were exploiting the flaw weeks before it was discovered and patched.",

        "content": "KrebsOnSecurity recently heard from a reader whose boss\u2019s email account got phished and was used to trick one of the company\u2019s customers into sending a large payment to scammers. An investigation into the attacker\u2019s infrastructure points to a long-running Nigerian cybercrime ring that is actively targeting established companies in the transportation and aviation industries.\n\nA reader who works in the transportation industry sent a tip about a recent successful phishing campaign that tricked an executive at the company into entering their credentials at a fake Microsoft 365 login page. From there, the attackers quickly mined the executive\u2019s inbox for past communications about invoices, copying and modifying some of those messages with new invoice demands that were sent to some of the company\u2019s customers and partners.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, the reader said the resulting phishing emails to customers came from a newly registered domain name that was remarkably similar to their employer\u2019s domain, and that at least one of their customers fell for the ruse and paid a phony invoice. They said the attackers had spun up a look-alike domain just a few hours after the executive\u2019s inbox credentials were phished, and that the scam resulted in a customer suffering a six-figure financial loss.\n\nThe reader also shared that the email addresses in the registration records for the imposter domain \u2014 roomservice801@gmail.com \u2014 is tied to many such phishing domains. Indeed, a search on this email address at DomainTools.com finds it is associated with at least 240 domains registered in 2024 or 2025. Virtually all of them mimic legitimate domains for companies in the aerospace and transportation industries worldwide.\n\nAn Internet search for this email address reveals a humorous blog post from 2020 on the Russian forum hackware[.]ru, which found roomservice801@gmail.com was tied to a phishing attack that used the lure of phony invoices to trick the recipient into logging in at a fake Microsoft login page. We\u2019ll come back to this research in a moment.\n\nJUSTY JOHN\n\nDomainTools shows that some of the early domains registered to roomservice801@gmail.com in 2016 include other useful information. For example, the WHOIS records for alhhomaidhicentre[.]biz reference the technical contact of \u201cJusty John\u201d and the email address justyjohn50@yahoo.com.\n\nA search at DomainTools found justyjohn50@yahoo.com has been registering one-off phishing domains since at least 2012. At this point, I was convinced that some security company surely had already published an analysis of this particular threat group, but I didn\u2019t yet have enough information to draw any solid conclusions.\n\nDomainTools says the Justy John email address is tied to more than two dozen domains registered since 2012, but we can find hundreds more phishing domains and related email addresses simply by pivoting on details in the registration records for these Justy John domains. For example, the street address used by the Justy John domain axisupdate[.]net \u2014 7902 Pelleaux Road in Knoxville, TN \u2014 also appears in the registration records for accountauthenticate[.]com, acctlogin[.]biz, and loginaccount[.]biz, all of which at one point included the email address rsmith60646@gmail.com.\n\nThat Rsmith Gmail address is connected to the 2012 phishing domain alibala[.]biz (one character off of the Chinese e-commerce giant alibaba.com, with a different top-level domain of .biz). A search in DomainTools on the phone number in those domain records \u2014 1.7736491613 \u2014 reveals even more phishing domains as well as the Nigerian phone number \u201c2348062918302\u201d and the email address michsmith59@gmail.com.\n\nDomainTools shows michsmith59@gmail.com appears in the registration records for the domain seltrock[.]com, which was used in the phishing attack documented in the 2020 Russian blog post mentioned earlier. At this point, we are just two steps away from identifying the threat actor group.\n\nThe same Nigerian phone number shows up in dozens of domain registrations that reference the email address sebastinekelly69@gmail.com, including 26i3[.]net, costamere[.]com, danagruop[.]us, and dividrilling[.]com. A Web search on any of those domains finds they were indexed in an \u201cindicator of compromise\u201d list on GitHub maintained by Palo Alto Networks\u2018 Unit 42 research team.\n\nSILVERTERRIER\n\nAccording to Unit 42, the domains are the handiwork of a vast cybercrime group based in Nigeria that it dubbed \u201cSilverTerrier\u201d back in 2014. In an October 2021 report, Palo Alto said SilverTerrier excels at so-called \u201cbusiness e-mail compromise\u201d or BEC scams, which target legitimate business email accounts through social engineering or computer intrusion activities. BEC criminals use that access to initiate or redirect the transfer of business funds for personal gain.\n\nPalo Alto says SilverTerrier encompasses hundreds of BEC fraudsters, some of whom have been arrested in various international law enforcement operations by Interpol. In 2022, Interpol and the Nigeria Police Force arrested 11 alleged SilverTerrier members, including a prominent SilverTerrier leader who\u2019d been flaunting his wealth on social media for years. Unfortunately, the lure of easy money, endemic poverty and corruption, and low barriers to entry for cybercrime in Nigeria conspire to provide a constant stream of new recruits.\n\nBEC scams were the 7th most reported crime tracked by the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) in 2024, generating more than 21,000 complaints. However, BEC scams were the second most costly form of cybercrime reported to the feds last year, with nearly $2.8 billion in claimed losses. In its 2025 Fraud and Control Survey Report, the Association for Financial Professionals found 63 percent of organizations experienced a BEC last year.\n\nPoking at some of the email addresses that spool out from this research reveals a number of Facebook accounts for people residing in Nigeria or in the United Arab Emirates, many of whom do not appear to have tried to mask their real-life identities. Palo Alto\u2019s Unit 42 researchers reached a similar conclusion, noting that although a small subset of these crooks went to great lengths to conceal their identities, it was usually simple to learn their identities on social media accounts and the major messaging services.\n\nPalo Alto said BEC actors have become far more organized over time, and that while it remains easy to find actors working as a group, the practice of using one phone number, email address or alias to register malicious infrastructure in support of multiple actors has made it far more time consuming (but not impossible) for cybersecurity and law enforcement organizations to sort out which actors committed specific crimes.\n\n\u201cWe continue to find that SilverTerrier actors, regardless of geographical location, are often connected through only a few degrees of separation on social media platforms,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nFINANCIAL FRAUD KILL CHAIN\n\nPalo Alto has published a useful list of recommendations that organizations can adopt to minimize the incidence and impact of BEC attacks. Many of those tips are prophylactic, such as conducting regular employee security training and reviewing network security policies.\n\nBut one recommendation \u2014 getting familiar with a process known as the \u201cfinancial fraud kill chain\u201d or FFKC \u2014 bears specific mention because it offers the single best hope for BEC victims who are seeking to claw back payments made to fraudsters, and yet far too many victims don\u2019t know it exists until it is too late.\n\nAs explained in this FBI primer, the International Financial Fraud Kill Chain is a partnership between federal law enforcement and financial entities whose purpose is to freeze fraudulent funds wired by victims. According to the FBI, viable victim complaints filed with ic3.gov promptly after a fraudulent transfer (generally less than 72 hours) will be automatically triaged by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).\n\nThe FBI noted in its IC3 annual report (PDF) that the FFKC had a 66 percent success rate in 2024. Viable ic3.gov complaints involve losses of at least $50,000, and include all records from the victim or victim bank, as well as a completed FFKC form (provided by FinCEN) containing victim information, recipient information, bank names, account numbers, location, SWIFT, and any additional information.",

        "content": "On Sunday, July 20, Microsoft Corp. issued an emergency security update for a vulnerability in SharePoint Server that is actively being exploited to compromise vulnerable organizations. The patch comes amid reports that malicious hackers have used the SharePoint flaw to breach U.S. federal and state agencies, universities, and energy companies.\n\nIn an advisory about the SharePoint security hole, a.k.a. CVE-2025-53770, Microsoft said it is aware of active attacks targeting on-premises SharePoint Server customers and exploiting vulnerabilities that were only partially addressed by the July 8, 2025 security update.\n\nThe Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) concurred, saying CVE-2025-53770 is a variant on a flaw Microsoft patched earlier this month (CVE-2025-49706). Microsoft notes the weakness applies only to SharePoint Servers that organizations use in-house, and that SharePoint Online and Microsoft 365 are not affected.\n\nThe Washington Post reported on Sunday that the U.S. government and partners in Canada and Australia are investigating the hack of SharePoint servers, which provide a platform for sharing and managing documents. The Post reports at least two U.S. federal agencies have seen their servers breached via the SharePoint vulnerability.\n\nAccording to CISA, attackers exploiting the newly-discovered flaw are retrofitting compromised servers with a backdoor dubbed \u201cToolShell\u201d that provides unauthenticated, remote access to systems. CISA said ToolShell enables attackers to fully access SharePoint content \u2014 including file systems and internal configurations \u2014 and execute code over the network.\n\nResearchers at Eye Security said they first spotted large-scale exploitation of the SharePoint flaw on July 18, 2025, and soon found dozens of separate servers compromised by the bug and infected with ToolShell. In a blog post, the researchers said the attacks sought to steal SharePoint server ASP.NET machine keys.\n\n\u201cThese keys can be used to facilitate further attacks, even at a later date,\u201d Eye Security warned. \u201cIt is critical that affected servers rotate SharePoint server ASP.NET machine keys and restart IIS on all SharePoint servers. Patching alone is not enough. We strongly advise defenders not to wait for a vendor fix before taking action. This threat is already operational and spreading rapidly.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s advisory says the company has issued updates for SharePoint Server Subscription Edition and SharePoint Server 2019, but that it is still working on updates for supported versions of SharePoint 2019 and SharePoint 2016.\n\nCISA advises vulnerable organizations to enable the anti-malware scan interface (AMSI) in SharePoint, to deploy Microsoft Defender AV on all SharePoint servers, and to disconnect affected products from the public-facing Internet until an official patch is available.\n\nThe security firm Rapid7 notes that Microsoft has described CVE-2025-53770 as related to a previous vulnerability \u2014 CVE-2025-49704, patched earlier this month \u2014 and that CVE-2025-49704 was part of an exploit chain demonstrated at the Pwn2Own hacking competition in May 2025. That exploit chain invoked a second SharePoint weakness \u2014 CVE-2025-49706 \u2014 which Microsoft unsuccessfully tried to fix in this month\u2019s Patch Tuesday.\n\nMicrosoft also has issued a patch for a related SharePoint vulnerability \u2014 CVE-2025-53771; Microsoft says there are no signs of active attacks on CVE-2025-53771, and that the patch is to provide more robust protections than the update for CVE-2025-49706.\n\nThis is a rapidly developing story. Any updates will be noted with timestamps.",

        "link": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/07/poor-passwords-tattle-on-ai-hiring-bot-maker-paradox-ai/",
        "content": "Security researchers recently revealed that the personal information of millions of people who applied for jobs at McDonald\u2019s was exposed after they guessed the password (\u201c123456\u201d) for the fast food chain\u2019s account at Paradox.ai, a company that makes artificial intelligence based hiring chatbots used by many Fortune 500 firms. Paradox.ai said the security oversight was an isolated incident that did not affect its other customers, but recent security breaches involving its employees in Vietnam tell a more nuanced story.\n\nEarlier this month, security researchers Ian Carroll and Sam Curry wrote about simple methods they found to access the backend of the AI chatbot platform on McHire.com, the McDonald\u2019s website that many of its franchisees use to screen job applicants. As first reported by Wired, the researchers discovered that the weak password used by Paradox exposed 64 million records, including applicants\u2019 names, email addresses and phone numbers.\n\nParadox.ai acknowledged the researchers\u2019 findings but said the company\u2019s other client instances were not affected, and that no sensitive information \u2014 such as Social Security numbers \u2014 was exposed.\n\n\u201cWe are confident, based on our records, this test account was not accessed by any third party other than the security researchers,\u201d the company wrote in a July 9 blog post. \u201cIt had not been logged into since 2019 and frankly, should have been decommissioned. We want to be very clear that while the researchers may have briefly had access to the system containing all chat interactions (NOT job applications), they only viewed and downloaded five chats in total that had candidate information within. Again, at no point was any data leaked online or made public.\u201d\n\nHowever, a review of stolen password data gathered by multiple breach-tracking services shows that at the end of June 2025, a Paradox.ai administrator in Vietnam suffered a malware compromise on their device that stole usernames and passwords for a variety of internal and third-party online services. The results were not pretty.\n\nThe password data from the Paradox.ai developer was stolen by a malware strain known as \u201cNexus Stealer,\u201d a form grabber and password stealer that is sold on cybercrime forums. The information snarfed by stealers like Nexus is often recovered and indexed by data leak aggregator services like Intelligence X, which reports that the malware on the Paradox.ai developer\u2019s device exposed hundreds of mostly poor and recycled passwords (using the same base password but slightly different characters at the end).\n\nThose purloined credentials show the developer in question at one point used the same seven-digit password to log in to Paradox.ai accounts for a number of Fortune 500 firms listed as customers on the company\u2019s website, including Aramark, Lockheed Martin, Lowes, and Pepsi.\n\nSeven-character passwords, particularly those consisting entirely of numerals, are highly vulnerable to \u201cbrute-force\u201d attacks that can try a large number of possible password combinations in quick succession. According to a much-referenced password strength guide maintained by Hive Systems, modern password-cracking systems can work out a seven number password more or less instantly.\n\nIn response to questions from KrebsOnSecurity, Paradox.ai confirmed that the password data was recently stolen by a malware infection on the personal device of a longtime Paradox developer based in Vietnam, and said the company was made aware of the compromise shortly after it happened. Paradox maintains that few of the exposed passwords were still valid, and that a majority of them were present on the employee\u2019s personal device only because he had migrated the contents of a password manager from an old computer.\n\nParadox also pointed out that it has been requiring single sign-on (SSO) authentication since 2020 that enforces multi-factor authentication for its partners. Still, a review of the exposed passwords shows they included the Vietnamese administrator\u2019s credentials to the company\u2019s SSO platform \u2014 paradoxai.okta.com. The password for that account ended in 202506 \u2014 possibly a reference to the month of June 2025 \u2014 and the digital cookie left behind after a successful Okta login with those credentials says it was valid until December 2025.\n\nAlso exposed were the administrator\u2019s credentials and authentication cookies for an account at Atlassian, a platform made for software development and project management. The expiration date for that authentication token likewise was December 2025.\n\nInfostealer infections are among the leading causes of data breaches and ransomware attacks today, and they result in the theft of stored passwords and any credentials the victim types into a browser. Most infostealer malware also will siphon authentication cookies stored on the victim\u2019s device, and depending on how those tokens are configured thieves may be able to use them to bypass login prompts and/or multi-factor authentication.\n\nQuite often these infostealer infections will open a backdoor on the victim\u2019s device that allows attackers to access the infected machine remotely. Indeed, it appears that remote access to the Paradox administrator\u2019s compromised device was offered for sale recently.\n\nIn February 2019, Paradox.ai announced it had successfully completed audits for two fairly comprehensive security standards (ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Type II). Meanwhile, the company\u2019s security disclosure this month says the test account with the atrocious 123456 username and password was last accessed in 2019, but somehow missed in their annual penetration tests. So how did it manage to pass such stringent security audits with these practices in place?\n\nParadox.ai told KrebsOnSecurity that at the time of the 2019 audit, the company\u2019s various contractors were not held to the same security standards the company practices internally. Paradox emphasized that this has changed, and that it has updated its security and password requirements multiple times since then.\n\nIt is unclear how the Paradox developer in Vietnam infected his computer with malware, but a closer review finds a Windows device for another Paradox.ai employee from Vietnam was compromised by similar data-stealing malware at the end of 2024 (that compromise included the victim\u2019s GitHub credentials). In the case of both employees, the stolen credential data includes Web browser logs that indicate the victims repeatedly downloaded pirated movies and television shows, which are often bundled with malware disguised as a video codec needed to view the pirated content.",

        "link": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/07/doge-denizen-marko-elez-leaked-api-key-for-xai/",
        "content": "Marko Elez, a 25-year-old employee at Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has been granted access to sensitive databases at the U.S. Social Security Administration, the Treasury and Justice departments, and the Department of Homeland Security. So it should fill all Americans with a deep sense of confidence to learn that Mr. Elez over the weekend inadvertently published a private key that allowed anyone to interact directly with more than four dozen large language models (LLMs) developed by Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company xAI.\n\nOn July 13, Mr. Elez committed a code script to GitHub called \u201cagent.py\u201d that included a private application programming interface (API) key for xAI. The inclusion of the private key was first flagged by GitGuardian, a company that specializes in detecting and remediating exposed secrets in public and proprietary environments. GitGuardian\u2019s systems constantly scan GitHub and other code repositories for exposed API keys, and fire off automated alerts to affected users.\n\nPhilippe Caturegli, \u201cchief hacking officer\u201d at the security consultancy Seralys, said the exposed API key allowed access to at least 52 different LLMs used by xAI. The most recent LLM in the list was called \u201cgrok-4-0709\u201d and was created on July 9, 2025.\n\nGrok, the generative AI chatbot developed by xAI and integrated into Twitter/X, relies on these and other LLMs (a query to Grok before publication shows Grok currently uses Grok-3, which was launched in Feburary 2025). Earlier today, xAI announced that the Department of Defense will begin using Grok as part of a contract worth up to $200 million. The contract award came less than a week after Grok began spewing antisemitic rants and invoking Adolf Hitler.\n\nMr. Elez did not respond to a request for comment. The code repository containing the private xAI key was removed shortly after Caturegli notified Elez via email. However, Caturegli said the exposed API key still works and has not yet been revoked.\n\n\u201cIf a developer can\u2019t keep an API key private, it raises questions about how they\u2019re handling far more sensitive government information behind closed doors,\u201d Caturegli told KrebsOnSecurity.\n\nPrior to joining DOGE, Marko Elez worked for a number of Musk\u2019s companies. His DOGE career began at the Department of the Treasury, and a legal battle over DOGE\u2019s access to Treasury databases showed Elez was sending unencrypted personal information in violation of the agency\u2019s policies.\n\nWhile still at Treasury, Elez resigned after The Wall Street Journal linked him to social media posts that advocated racism and eugenics. When Vice President J.D. Vance lobbied for Elez to be rehired, President Trump agreed and Musk reinstated him.\n\nSince his re-hiring as a DOGE employee, Elez has been granted access to databases at one federal agency after another. TechCrunch reported in February 2025 that he was working at the Social Security Administration. In March, Business Insider found Elez was part of a DOGE detachment assigned to the Department of Labor.\n\nIn April, The New York Times reported that Elez held positions at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) bureaus, as well as the Department of Homeland Security. The Washington Post later reported that Elez, while serving as a DOGE advisor at the Department of Justice, had gained access to the Executive Office for Immigration Review\u2019s Courts and Appeals System (EACS).\n\nElez is not the first DOGE worker to publish internal API keys for xAI: In May, KrebsOnSecurity detailed how another DOGE employee leaked a private xAI key on GitHub for two months, exposing LLMs that were custom made for working with internal data from Musk\u2019s companies, including SpaceX, Tesla and Twitter/X.\n\nCaturegli said it\u2019s difficult to trust someone with access to confidential government systems when they can\u2019t even manage the basics of operational security.\n\n\u201cOne leak is a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when the same type of sensitive key gets exposed again and again, it\u2019s not just bad luck, it\u2019s a sign of deeper negligence and a broken security culture.\u201d",

        "link": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/07/uk-charges-four-in-scattered-spider-ransom-group/",
        "content": "Authorities in the United Kingdom this week arrested four people aged 17 to 20 in connection with recent data theft and extortion attacks against the retailers Marks & Spencer and Harrods, and the British food retailer Co-op Group. The breaches have been linked to a prolific but loosely-affiliated cybercrime group dubbed \u201cScattered Spider,\u201d whose other recent victims include multiple airlines.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s National Crime Agency (NCA) declined verify the names of those arrested, saying only that they included two males aged 19, another aged 17, and 20-year-old female.\n\nScattered Spider is the name given to an English-speaking cybercrime group known for using social engineering tactics to break into companies and steal data for ransom, often impersonating employees or contractors to deceive IT help desks into granting access. The FBI warned last month that Scattered Spider had recently shifted to targeting companies in the retail and airline sectors.\n\nKrebsOnSecurity has learned the identities of two of the suspects. Multiple sources close to the investigation said those arrested include Owen David Flowers, a U.K. man alleged to have been involved in the cyber intrusion and ransomware attack that shut down several MGM Casino properties in September 2023. Those same sources said the woman arrested is or recently was in a relationship with Flowers.\n\nSources told KrebsOnSecurity that Flowers, who allegedly went by the hacker handles \u201cbo764,\u201d \u201cHoly,\u201d and \u201cNazi,\u201d was the group member who anonymously gave interviews to the media in the days after the MGM hack. His real name was omitted from a September 2024 story about the group because he was not yet charged in that incident.\n\nThe bigger fish arrested this week is 19-year-old Thalha Jubair, a U.K. man whose alleged exploits under various monikers have been well-documented in stories on this site. Jubair is believed to have used the nickname \u201cEarth2Star,\u201d which corresponds to a founding member of the cybercrime-focused Telegram channel \u201cStar Fraud Chat.\u201d\n\nIn 2023, KrebsOnSecurity published an investigation into the work of three different SIM-swapping groups that phished credentials from T-Mobile employees and used that access to offer a service whereby any T-Mobile phone number could be swapped to a new device. Star Chat was by far the most active and consequential of the three SIM-swapping groups, who collectively broke into T-Mobile\u2019s network more than 100 times in the second half of 2022.\n\nSources tell KrebsOnSecurity that Jubair also was a core member of the LAPSUS$ cybercrime group that broke into dozens of technology companies in 2022, stealing source code and other internal data from tech giants including Microsoft, Nvidia, Okta, Rockstar Games, Samsung, T-Mobile, and Uber.\n\nIn April 2022, KrebsOnSecurity published internal chat records from LAPSUS$, and those chats indicated Jubair was using the nicknames Amtrak and Asyntax. At one point in the chats, Amtrak told the LAPSUS$ group leader not to share T-Mobile\u2019s logo in images sent to the group because he\u2019d been previously busted for SIM-swapping and his parents would suspect he was back at it again.\n\nAs shown in those chats, the leader of LAPSUS$ eventually decided to betray Amtrak by posting his real name, phone number, and other hacker handles into a public chat room on Telegram.\n\nThat story about the leaked LAPSUS$ chats connected Amtrak/Asyntax/Jubair to the identity \u201cEverlynn,\u201d the founder of a cybercriminal service that sold fraudulent \u201cemergency data requests\u201d targeting the major social media and email providers. In such schemes, the hackers compromise email accounts tied to police departments and government agencies, and then send unauthorized demands for subscriber data while claiming the information being requested can\u2019t wait for a court order because it relates to an urgent matter of life and death.\n\nSources say Jubair also used the nickname \u201cOperator,\u201d and that until recently he was the administrator of the Doxbin, a long-running and highly toxic online community that is used to \u201cdox\u201d or post deeply personal information on people. In May 2024, several popular cybercrime channels on Telegram ridiculed Operator after it was revealed that he\u2019d staged his own kidnapping in a botched plan to throw off law enforcement investigators.\n\nIn November 2024, U.S. authorities charged five men aged 20 to 25 in connection with the Scattered Spider group, which has long relied on recruiting minors to carry out its most risky activities. Indeed, many of the group\u2019s core members were recruited from online gaming platforms like Roblox and Minecraft in their early teens, and have been perfecting their social engineering tactics for years.\n\n\u201cThere is a clear pattern that some of the most depraved threat actors first joined cybercrime gangs at an exceptionally young age,\u201d said Allison Nixon, chief research officer at the New York based security firm Unit 221B. \u201cCybercriminals arrested at 15 or younger need serious intervention and monitoring to prevent a years long massive escalation.\u201d",

        "link": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/07/microsoft-patch-tuesday-july-2025-edition/",
        "content": "Microsoft today released updates to fix at least 137 security vulnerabilities in its Windows operating systems and supported software. None of the weaknesses addressed this month are known to be actively exploited, but 14 of the flaws earned Microsoft\u2019s most-dire \u201ccritical\u201d rating, meaning they could be exploited to seize control over vulnerable Windows PCs with little or no help from users.\n\nWhile not listed as critical, CVE-2025-49719 is a publicly disclosed information disclosure vulnerability, with all versions as far back as SQL Server 2016 receiving patches. Microsoft rates CVE-2025-49719 as less likely to be exploited, but the availability of proof-of-concept code for this flaw means its patch should probably be a priority for affected enterprises.\n\nMike Walters, co-founder of Action1, said CVE-2025-49719 can be exploited without authentication, and that many third-party applications depend on SQL server and the affected drivers \u2014 potentially introducing a supply-chain risk that extends beyond direct SQL Server users.\n\n\u201cThe potential exposure of sensitive information makes this a high-priority concern for organizations handling valuable or regulated data,\u201d Walters said. \u201cThe comprehensive nature of the affected versions, spanning multiple SQL Server releases from 2016 through 2022, indicates a fundamental issue in how SQL Server handles memory management and input validation.\u201d\n\nAdam Barnett at Rapid7 notes that today is the end of the road for SQL Server 2012, meaning there will be no future security patches even for critical vulnerabilities, even if you\u2019re willing to pay Microsoft for the privilege.\n\nBarnett also called attention to CVE-2025-47981, a vulnerability with a CVSS score of 9.8 (10 being the worst), a remote code execution bug in the way Windows servers and clients negotiate to discover mutually supported authentication mechanisms. This pre-authentication vulnerability affects any Windows client machine running Windows 10 1607 or above, and all current versions of Windows Server. Microsoft considers it more likely that attackers will exploit this flaw.\n\nMicrosoft also patched at least four critical, remote code execution flaws in Office (CVE-2025-49695, CVE-2025-49696, CVE-2025-49697, CVE-2025-49702). The first two are both rated by Microsoft as having a higher likelihood of exploitation, do not require user interaction, and can be triggered through the Preview Pane.\n\nTwo more high severity bugs include CVE-2025-49740 (CVSS 8.8) and CVE-2025-47178 (CVSS 8.0); the former is a weakness that could allow malicious files to bypass screening by Microsoft Defender SmartScreen, a built-in feature of Windows that tries to block untrusted downloads and malicious sites.\n\nCVE-2025-47178 involves a remote code execution flaw in Microsoft Configuration Manager, an enterprise tool for managing, deploying, and securing computers, servers, and devices across a network. Ben Hopkins at Immersive said this bug requires very low privileges to exploit, and that it is possible for a user or attacker with a read-only access role to exploit it.\n\n\u201cExploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries as the privileged SMS service account in Microsoft Configuration Manager,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cThis access can be used to manipulate deployments, push malicious software or scripts to all managed devices, alter configurations, steal sensitive data, and potentially escalate to full operating system code execution across the enterprise, giving the attacker broad control over the entire IT environment.\u201d\n\nSeparately, Adobe has released security updates for a broad range of software, including After Effects, Adobe Audition, Illustrator, FrameMaker, and ColdFusion.\n\nThe SANS Internet Storm Center has a breakdown of each individual patch, indexed by severity. If you\u2019re responsible for administering a number of Windows systems, it may be worth keeping an eye on AskWoody for the lowdown on any potentially wonky updates (considering the large number of vulnerabilities and Windows components addressed this month).\n\nIf you\u2019re a Windows home user, please consider backing up your data and/or drive before installing any patches, and drop a note in the comments if you encounter any problems with these updates.",

        "link": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/07/big-techs-mixed-response-to-u-s-treasury-sanctions/",
        "content": "In May 2025, the U.S. government sanctioned a Chinese national for operating a cloud provider linked to the majority of virtual currency investment scam websites reported to the FBI. But a new report finds the accused continues to operate a slew of established accounts at American tech companies \u2014 including Facebook, Github, PayPal and Twitter/X.\n\nOn May 29, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced economic sanctions against Funnull Technology Inc., a Philippines-based company alleged to provide infrastructure for hundreds of thousands of websites involved in virtual currency investment scams known as \u201cpig butchering.\u201d In January 2025, KrebsOnSecurity detailed how Funnull was designed as a content delivery network that catered to foreign cybercriminals seeking to route their traffic through U.S.-based cloud providers.\n\nThe Treasury also sanctioned Funnull\u2019s alleged operator, a 40-year-old Chinese national named Liu \u201cSteve\u201d Lizhi. The government says Funnull directly facilitated financial schemes resulting in more than $200 million in financial losses by Americans, and that the company\u2019s operations were linked to the majority of pig butchering scams reported to the FBI.\n\nIt is generally illegal for U.S. companies or individuals to transact with people sanctioned by the Treasury. However, as Mr. Lizhi\u2019s case makes clear, just because someone is sanctioned doesn\u2019t necessarily mean big tech companies are going to suspend their online accounts.\n\nThe government says Lizhi was born November 13, 1984, and used the nicknames \u201cXXL4\u201d and \u201cNice Lizhi.\u201d Nevertheless, Steve Liu\u2019s 17-year-old account on LinkedIn (in the name \u201cLiulizhi\u201d) had hundreds of followers (Lizhi\u2019s LinkedIn profile helpfully confirms his birthday) until quite recently: The account was deleted this morning, just hours after KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from LinkedIn.\n\nIn an emailed response, a LinkedIn spokesperson said the company\u2019s \u201cProhibited countries policy\u201d states that LinkedIn \u201cdoes not sell, license, support or otherwise make available its Premium accounts or other paid products and services to individuals and companies sanctioned by the U.S. government.\u201d LinkedIn declined to say whether the profile in question was a premium or free account.\n\nMr. Lizhi also maintains a working PayPal account under the name Liu Lizhi and username \u201c@nicelizhi,\u201d another nickname listed in the Treasury sanctions. A 15-year-old Twitter/X account named \u201cLizhi\u201d that links to Mr. Lizhi\u2019s personal domain remains active, although it has few followers and hasn\u2019t posted in years.\n\nThese accounts and many others were flagged by the security firm Silent Push, which has been tracking Funnull\u2019s operations for the past year and calling out U.S. cloud providers like Amazon and Microsoft for failing to more quickly sever ties with the company.\n\nIn a report released today, Silent Push found Lizhi still operates numerous Facebook accounts and groups, including a private Facebook account under the name Liu Lizhi. Another Facebook account clearly connected to Lizhi is a tourism page for Ganzhou, China called \u201cEnjoyGanzhou\u201d that was named in the Treasury Department sanctions.\n\n\u201cThis guy is the technical administrator for the infrastructure that is hosting a majority of scams targeting people in the United States, and hundreds of millions have been lost based on the websites he\u2019s been hosting,\u201d said Zach Edwards, senior threat researcher at Silent Push. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy that the vast majority of big tech companies haven\u2019t done anything to cut ties with this guy.\u201d\n\nThe FBI says it received nearly 150,000 complaints last year involving digital assets and $9.3 billion in losses \u2014 a 66 percent increase from the previous year. Investment scams were the top crypto-related crimes reported, with $5.8 billion in losses.\n\nIn a statement, a Meta spokesperson said the company continuously takes steps to meet its legal obligations, but that sanctions laws are complex and varied. They explained that sanctions are often targeted in nature and don\u2019t always prohibit people from having a presence on its platform. Nevertheless, Meta confirmed it had removed the account, unpublished Pages, and removed Groups and events associated with the user for violating its policies.\n\nAttempts to reach Mr. Lizhi via his primary email addresses at Hotmail and Gmail bounced as undeliverable. Likewise, his 14-year-old YouTube channel appears to have been taken down recently.\n\nHowever, anyone interested in viewing or using Mr. Lizhi\u2019s 146 computer code repositories will have no problem finding GitHub accounts for him, including one registered under the NiceLizhi and XXL4 nicknames mentioned in the Treasury sanctions.\n\nMr. Lizhi also operates a GitHub page for an open source e-commerce platform called NexaMerchant, which advertises itself as a payment gateway working with numerous American financial institutions. Interestingly, this profile\u2019s \u201cfollowers\u201d page shows several other accounts that appear to be Mr. Lizhi\u2019s. All of the account\u2019s followers are tagged as \u201csuspended,\u201d even though that suspended message does not display when one visits those individual profiles.\n\nIn response to questions, GitHub said it has a process in place to identify when users and customers are Specially Designated Nationals or other denied or blocked parties, but that it locks those accounts instead of removing them. According to its policy, GitHub takes care that users and customers aren\u2019t impacted beyond what is required by law.\n\n\u201cThis includes keeping public repositories, including those for open source projects, available and accessible to support personal communications involving developers in sanctioned regions,\u201d the policy states. \u201cThis also means GitHub will advocate for developers in sanctioned regions to enjoy greater access to the platform and full access to the global open source community.\u201d\n\nEdwards said it\u2019s great that GitHub has a process for handling sanctioned accounts, but that the process doesn\u2019t seem to communicate risk in a transparent way, noting that the only indicator on the locked accounts is the message, \u201cThis repository has been archived by the owner. It is not read-only.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an odd message that doesn\u2019t communicate, \u2018This is a sanctioned entity, don\u2019t fork this code or use it in a production environment\u2019,\u201d Edwards said.\n\nMark Rasch is a former federal cybercrime prosecutor who now serves as counsel for the New York City based security consulting firm Unit 221B. Rasch said when Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions a person or entity, it then becomes illegal for businesses or organizations to transact with the sanctioned party.\n\nRasch said financial institutions have very mature systems for severing accounts tied to people who become subject to OFAC sanctions, but that tech companies may be far less proactive \u2014 particularly with free accounts.\n\n\u201cBanks have established ways of checking [U.S. government sanctions lists] for sanctioned entities, but tech companies don\u2019t necessarily do a good job with that, especially for services that you can just click and sign up for,\u201d Rasch said. \u201cIt\u2019s potentially a risk and liability for the tech companies involved, but only to the extent OFAC is willing to enforce it.\u201d\n\nIn July 2024, Funnull purchased the domain polyfill[.]io, the longtime home of a legitimate open source project that allowed websites to ensure that devices using legacy browsers could still render content in newer formats. After the Polyfill domain changed hands, at least 384,000 websites were caught in a supply-chain attack that redirected visitors to malicious sites. According to the Treasury, Funnull used the code to redirect people to scam websites and online gambling sites, some of which were linked to Chinese criminal money laundering operations.\n\nThe U.S. government says Funnull provides domain names for websites on its purchased IP addresses, using domain generation algorithms (DGAs) \u2014 programs that generate large numbers of similar but unique names for websites \u2014 and that it sells web design templates to cybercriminals.\n\n\u201cThese services not only make it easier for cybercriminals to impersonate trusted brands when creating scam websites, but also allow them to quickly change to different domain names and IP addresses when legitimate providers attempt to take the websites down,\u201d reads a Treasury statement.\n\nMeanwhile, Funnull appears to be morphing nearly all aspects of its business in the wake of the sanctions, Edwards said.\n\n\u201cWhereas before they might have used 60 DGA domains to hide and bounce their traffic, we\u2019re seeing far more now,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to make their infrastructure harder to track and more complicated, so for now they\u2019re not going away but more just changing what they\u2019re doing. And a lot more organizations should be holding their feet to the fire.\u201d\n\nUpdate, 2:48 PM ET: Added response from Meta, which confirmed it has closed the accounts and groups connected to Mr. Lizhi.\n\nUpdate, July 7, 6:56 p.m. ET: In a written statement, PayPal said it continually works to combat and prevent the illicit use of its services.\n\n\u201cWe devote significant resources globally to financial crime compliance, and we proactively refer cases to and assist law enforcement officials around the world in their efforts to identify, investigate and stop illegal activity,\u201d the statement reads.",

        "link": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/06/senator-chides-fbi-for-weak-advice-on-mobile-security/",
        "content": "Agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) briefed Capitol Hill staff recently on hardening the security of their mobile devices, after a contacts list stolen from the personal phone of the White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles was reportedly used to fuel a series of text messages and phone calls impersonating her to U.S. lawmakers. But in a letter this week to the FBI, one of the Senate\u2019s most tech-savvy lawmakers says the feds aren\u2019t doing enough to recommend more appropriate security protections that are already built into most consumer mobile devices.\n\nOn May 29, The Wall Street Journal reported that federal authorities were investigating a clandestine effort to impersonate Ms. Wiles via text messages and in phone calls that may have used AI to spoof her voice. According to The Journal, Wiles told associates her cellphone contacts were hacked, giving the impersonator access to the private phone numbers of some of the country\u2019s most influential people.\n\nThe execution of this phishing and impersonation campaign \u2014 whatever its goals may have been \u2014 suggested the attackers were financially motivated, and not particularly sophisticated.\n\n\u201cIt became clear to some of the lawmakers that the requests were suspicious when the impersonator began asking questions about Trump that Wiles should have known the answers to\u2014and in one case, when the impersonator asked for a cash transfer, some of the people said,\u201d the Journal wrote. \u201cIn many cases, the impersonator\u2019s grammar was broken and the messages were more formal than the way Wiles typically communicates, people who have received the messages said. The calls and text messages also didn\u2019t come from Wiles\u2019s phone number.\u201d\n\nSophisticated or not, the impersonation campaign was soon punctuated by the murder of Minnesota House of Representatives Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the shooting of Minnesota State Senator John Hoffman and his wife. So when FBI agents offered in mid-June to brief U.S. Senate staff on mobile threats, more than 140 staffers took them up on that invitation (a remarkably high number considering that no food was offered at the event).\n\nBut according to Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the advice the FBI provided to Senate staffers was largely limited to remedial tips, such as not clicking on suspicious links or attachments, not using public wifi networks, turning off bluetooth, keeping phone software up to date, and rebooting regularly.\n\n\u201cThis is insufficient to protect Senate employees and other high-value targets against foreign spies using advanced cyber tools,\u201d Wyden wrote in a letter sent today to FBI Director Kash Patel. \u201cWell-funded foreign intelligence agencies do not have to rely on phishing messages and malicious attachments to infect unsuspecting victims with spyware. Cyber mercenary companies sell their government customers advanced \u2018zero-click\u2019 capabilities to deliver spyware that do not require any action by the victim.\u201d\n\nWyden stressed that to help counter sophisticated attacks, the FBI should be encouraging lawmakers and their staff to enable anti-spyware defenses that are built into Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android phone software.\n\nThese include Apple\u2019s Lockdown Mode, which is designed for users who are worried they may be subject to targeted attacks. Lockdown Mode restricts non-essential iOS features to reduce the device\u2019s overall attack surface. Google Android devices carry a similar feature called Advanced Protection Mode.\n\nWyden also urged the FBI to update its training to recommend a number of other steps that people can take to make their mobile devices less trackable, including the use of ad blockers to guard against malicious advertisements, disabling ad tracking IDs in mobile devices, and opting out of commercial data brokers (the suspect charged in the Minnesota shootings reportedly used multiple people-search services to find the home addresses of his targets).\n\nThe senator\u2019s letter notes that while the FBI has recommended all of the above precautions in various advisories issued over the years, the advice the agency is giving now to the nation\u2019s leaders needs to be more comprehensive, actionable and urgent.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the seriousness of the threat, the FBI has yet to provide effective defensive guidance,\u201d Wyden said.\n\nNicholas Weaver is a researcher with the International Computer Science Institute, a nonprofit in Berkeley, Calif. Weaver said Lockdown Mode or Advanced Protection will mitigate many vulnerabilities, and should be the default setting for all members of Congress and their staff.\n\n\u201cLawmakers are at exceptional risk and need to be exceptionally protected,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cTheir computers should be locked down and well administered, etc. And the same applies to staffers.\u201d\n\nWeaver noted that Apple\u2019s Lockdown Mode has a track record of blocking zero-day attacks on iOS applications; in September 2023, Citizen Lab documented how Lockdown Mode foiled a zero-click flaw capable of installing spyware on iOS devices without any interaction from the victim.\n\nEarlier this month, Citizen Lab researchers documented a zero-click attack used to infect the iOS devices of two journalists with Paragon\u2019s Graphite spyware. The vulnerability could be exploited merely by sending the target a booby-trapped media file delivered via iMessage. Apple also recently updated its advisory for the zero-click flaw (CVE-2025-43200), noting that it was mitigated as of iOS 18.3.1, which was released in February 2025.\n\nApple has not commented on whether CVE-2025-43200 could be exploited on devices with Lockdown Mode turned on. But HelpNetSecurity observed that at the same time Apple addressed CVE-2025-43200 back in February, the company fixed another vulnerability flagged by Citizen Lab researcher Bill Marczak: CVE-2025-24200, which Apple said was used in an extremely sophisticated physical attack against specific targeted individuals that allowed attackers to disable USB Restricted Mode on a locked device.\n\nIn other words, the flaw could apparently be exploited only if the attacker had physical access to the targeted vulnerable device. And as the old infosec industry adage goes, if an adversary has physical access to your device, it\u2019s most likely not your device anymore.\n\nI can\u2019t speak to Google\u2019s Advanced Protection Mode personally, because I don\u2019t use Google or Android devices. But I have had Apple\u2019s Lockdown Mode enabled on all of my Apple devices since it was first made available in September 2022. I can only think of a single occasion when one of my apps failed to work properly with Lockdown Mode turned on, and in that case I was able to add a temporary exception for that app in Lockdown Mode\u2019s settings.\n\nMy main gripe with Lockdown Mode was captured in a March 2025 column by TechCrunch\u2019s Lorenzo Francheschi-Bicchierai, who wrote about its penchant for periodically sending mystifying notifications that someone has been blocked from contacting you, even though nothing then prevents you from contacting that person directly. This has happened to me at least twice, and in both cases the person in question was already an approved contact, and said they had not attempted to reach out.\n\nAlthough it would be nice if Apple\u2019s Lockdown Mode sent fewer, less alarming and more informative alerts, the occasional baffling warning message is hardly enough to make me turn it off.",

        "link": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/06/inside-a-dark-adtech-empire-fed-by-fake-captchas/",
        "content": "Late last year, security researchers made a startling discovery: Kremlin-backed disinformation campaigns were bypassing moderation on social media platforms by leveraging the same malicious advertising technology that powers a sprawling ecosystem of online hucksters and website hackers. A new report on the fallout from that investigation finds this dark ad tech industry is far more resilient and incestuous than previously known.\n\nIn November 2024, researchers at the security firm Qurium published an investigation into \u201cDoppelganger,\u201d a disinformation network that promotes pro-Russian narratives and infiltrates Europe\u2019s media landscape by pushing fake news through a network of cloned websites.\n\nDoppelganger campaigns use specialized links that bounce the visitor\u2019s browser through a long series of domains before the fake news content is served. Qurium found Doppelganger relies on a sophisticated \u201cdomain cloaking\u201d service, a technology that allows websites to present different content to search engines compared to what regular visitors see. The use of cloaking services helps the disinformation sites remain online longer than they otherwise would, while ensuring that only the targeted audience gets to view the intended content.\n\nQurium discovered that Doppelganger\u2019s cloaking service also promoted online dating sites, and shared much of the same infrastructure with VexTrio, which is thought to be the oldest malicious traffic distribution system (TDS) in existence. While TDSs are commonly used by legitimate advertising networks to manage traffic from disparate sources and to track who or what is behind each click, VexTrio\u2019s TDS largely manages web traffic from victims of phishing, malware, and social engineering scams.\n\nBREAKING BAD\n\nDigging deeper, Qurium noticed Doppelganger\u2019s cloaking service used an Internet provider in Switzerland as the first entry point in a chain of domain redirections. They also noticed the same infrastructure hosted a pair of co-branded affiliate marketing services that were driving traffic to sketchy adult dating sites: LosPollos[.]com and TacoLoco[.]co.\n\nThe LosPollos ad network incorporates many elements and references from the hit series \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d mirroring the fictional \u201cLos Pollos Hermanos\u201d restaurant chain that served as a money laundering operation for a violent methamphetamine cartel.\n\nAffiliates who sign up with LosPollos are given JavaScript-heavy \u201csmartlinks\u201d that drive traffic into the VexTrio TDS, which in turn distributes the traffic among a variety of advertising partners, including dating services, sweepstakes offers, bait-and-switch mobile apps, financial scams and malware download sites.\n\nLosPollos affiliates typically stitch these smart links into WordPress websites that have been hacked via known vulnerabilities, and those affiliates will earn a small commission each time an Internet user referred by any of their hacked sites falls for one of these lures.\n\nAccording to Qurium, TacoLoco is a traffic monetization network that uses deceptive tactics to trick Internet users into enabling \u201cpush notifications,\u201d a cross-platform browser standard that allows websites to show pop-up messages which appear outside of the browser. For example, on Microsoft Windows systems these notifications typically show up in the bottom right corner of the screen \u2014 just above the system clock.\n\nIn the case of VexTrio and TacoLoco, the notification approval requests themselves are deceptive \u2014 disguised as \u201cCAPTCHA\u201d challenges designed to distinguish automated bot traffic from real visitors. For years, VexTrio and its partners have successfully tricked countless users into enabling these site notifications, which are then used to continuously pepper the victim\u2019s device with a variety of phony virus alerts and misleading pop-up messages.\n\nAccording to a December 2024 annual report from GoDaddy, nearly 40 percent of compromised websites in 2024 redirected visitors to VexTrio via LosPollos smartlinks.\n\nADSPRO AND TEKNOLOGY\n\nOn November 14, 2024, Qurium published research to support its findings that LosPollos and TacoLoco were services operated by Adspro Group, a company registered in the Czech Republic and Russia, and that Adspro runs its infrastructure at the Swiss hosting providers C41 and Teknology SA.\n\nQurium noted the LosPollos and TacoLoco sites state that their content is copyrighted by ByteCore AG and SkyForge Digital AG, both Swiss firms that are run by the owner of Teknology SA, Giulio Vitorrio Leonardo Cerutti. Further investigation revealed LosPollos and TacoLoco were apps developed by a company called Holacode, which lists Cerutti as its CEO.\n\nThe apps marketed by Holacode include numerous VPN services, as well as one called Spamshield that claims to stop unwanted push notifications. But in January, Infoblox said they tested the app on their own mobile devices, and found it hides the user\u2019s notifications, and then after 24 hours stops hiding them and demands payment. Spamshield subsequently changed its developer name from Holacode to ApLabz, although Infoblox noted that the Terms of Service for several of the rebranded ApLabz apps still referenced Holacode in their terms of service.\n\nIncredibly, Cerutti threatened to sue me for defamation before I\u2019d even uttered his name or sent him a request for comment (Cerutti sent the unsolicited legal threat back in January after his company and my name were merely tagged in an Infoblox post on LinkedIn about VexTrio).\n\nAsked to comment on the findings by Qurium and Infoblox, Cerutti vehemently denied being associated with VexTrio. Cerutti asserted that his companies all strictly adhere to the regulations of the countries in which they operate, and that they have been completely transparent about all of their operations.\n\n\u201cWe are a group operating in the advertising and marketing space, with an affiliate network program,\u201d Cerutti responded. \u201cI am not [going] to say we are perfect, but I strongly declare we have no connection with VexTrio at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, as a big player in this space we also get to deal with plenty of publisher fraud, sketchy traffic, fake clicks, bots, hacked, listed and resold publisher accounts, etc, etc.,\u201d Cerutti continued. \u201cWe bleed lots of money to such malpractices and conduct regular internal screenings and audits in a constant battle to remove bad traffic sources. It is also a highly competitive space, where some upstarts will often play dirty against more established mainstream players like us.\u201d\n\nWorking with Qurium, researchers at the security firm Infoblox released details about VexTrio\u2019s infrastructure to their industry partners. Just four days after Qurium published its findings, LosPollos announced it was suspending its push monetization service. Less than a month later, Adspro had rebranded to Aimed Global.\n\nA REVEALING PIVOT\n\nIn March 2025, researchers at GoDaddy chronicled how DollyWay \u2014 a malware strain that has consistently redirected victims to VexTrio throughout its eight years of activity \u2014 suddenly stopped doing that on November 20, 2024. Virtually overnight, DollyWay and several other malware families that had previously used VexTrio began pushing their traffic through another TDS called Help TDS.\n\nDigging further into historical DNS records and the unique code scripts used by the Help TDS, Infoblox determined it has long enjoyed an exclusive relationship with VexTrio (at least until LosPollos ended its push monetization service in November).\n\nIn a report released today, Infoblox said an exhaustive analysis of the JavaScript code, website lures, smartlinks and DNS patterns used by VexTrio and Help TDS linked them with at least four other TDS operators (not counting TacoLoco). Those four entities \u2014 Partners House, BroPush, RichAds and RexPush \u2014 are all Russia-based push monetization programs that pay affiliates to drive signups for a variety of schemes, but mostly online dating services.\n\n\u201cAs Los Pollos push monetization ended, we\u2019ve seen an increase in fake CAPTCHAs that drive user acceptance of push notifications, particularly from Partners House,\u201d the Infoblox report reads. \u201cThe relationship of these commercial entities remains a mystery; while they are certainly long-time partners redirecting traffic to one another, and they all have a Russian nexus, there is no overt common ownership.\u201d\n\nRenee Burton, vice president of threat intelligence at Infoblox, said the security industry generally treats the deceptive methods used by VexTrio and other malicious TDSs as a kind of legally grey area that is mostly associated with less dangerous security threats, such as adware and scareware.\n\nBut Burton argues that this view is myopic, and helps perpetuate a dark adtech industry that also pushes plenty of straight-up malware, noting that hundreds of thousands of compromised websites around the world every year redirect victims to the tangled web of VexTrio and VexTrio-affiliate TDSs.\n\n\u201cThese TDSs are a nefarious threat, because they\u2019re the ones you can connect to the delivery of things like information stealers and scams that cost consumers billions of dollars a year,\u201d Burton said. \u201cFrom a larger strategic perspective, my takeaway is that Russian organized crime has control of malicious adtech, and these are just some of the many groups involved.\u201d\n\nWHAT CAN YOU DO?\n\nAs KrebsOnSecurity warned way back in 2020, it\u2019s a good idea to be very sparing in approving notifications when browsing the Web. In many cases these notifications are benign, but as we\u2019ve seen there are numerous dodgy firms that are paying site owners to install their notification scripts, and then reselling that communications pathway to scammers and online hucksters.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to prevent sites from ever presenting notification requests, all of the major browser makers let you do this \u2014 either across the board or on a per-website basis. While it is true that blocking notifications entirely can break the functionality of some websites, doing this for any devices you manage on behalf of your less tech-savvy friends or family members might end up saving everyone a lot of headache down the road.\n\nTo modify site notification settings in Mozilla Firefox, navigate to Settings, Privacy & Security, Permissions, and click the \u201cSettings\u201d tab next to \u201cNotifications.\u201d That page will display any notifications already permitted and allow you to edit or delete any entries. Tick the box next to \u201cBlock new requests asking to allow notifications\u201d to stop them altogether.\n\nIn Google Chrome, click the icon with the three dots to the right of the address bar, scroll all the way down to Settings, Privacy and Security, Site Settings, and Notifications. Select the \u201cDon\u2019t allow sites to send notifications\u201d button if you want to banish notification requests forever.\n\nIn Apple\u2019s Safari browser, go to Settings, Websites, and click on Notifications in the sidebar. Uncheck the option to \u201callow websites to ask for permission to send notifications\u201d if you wish to turn off notification requests entirely.",

        "content": "Microsoft today released security updates to fix at least 67 vulnerabilities in its Windows operating systems and software. Redmond warns that one of the flaws is already under active attack, and that software blueprints showing how to exploit a pervasive Windows bug patched this month are now public.\n\nThe sole zero-day flaw this month is CVE-2025-33053, a remote code execution flaw in the Windows implementation of WebDAV \u2014 an HTTP extension that lets users remotely manage files and directories on a server. While WebDAV isn\u2019t enabled by default in Windows, its presence in legacy or specialized systems still makes it a relevant target, said Seth Hoyt, senior security engineer at Automox.\n\nAdam Barnett, lead software engineer at Rapid7, said Microsoft\u2019s advisory for CVE-2025-33053 does not mention that the Windows implementation of WebDAV is listed as deprecated since November 2023, which in practical terms means that the WebClient service no longer starts by default.\n\n\u201cThe advisory also has attack complexity as low, which means that exploitation does not require preparation of the target environment in any way that is beyond the attacker\u2019s control,\u201d Barnett said. \u201cExploitation relies on the user clicking a malicious link. It\u2019s not clear how an asset would be immediately vulnerable if the service isn\u2019t running, but all versions of Windows receive a patch, including those released since the deprecation of WebClient, like Server 2025 and Windows 11 24H2.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft warns that an \u201celevation of privilege\u201d vulnerability in the Windows Server Message Block (SMB) client (CVE-2025-33073) is likely to be exploited, given that proof-of-concept code for this bug is now public. CVE-2025-33073 has a CVSS risk score of 8.8 (out of 10), and exploitation of the flaw leads to the attacker gaining \u201cSYSTEM\u201d level control over a vulnerable PC.\n\n\u201cWhat makes this especially dangerous is that no further user interaction is required after the initial connection\u2014something attackers can often trigger without the user realizing it,\u201d said Alex Vovk, co-founder and CEO of Action1. \u201cGiven the high privilege level and ease of exploitation, this flaw poses a significant risk to Windows environments. The scope of affected systems is extensive, as SMB is a core Windows protocol used for file and printer sharing and inter-process communication.\u201d\n\nBeyond these highlights, 10 of the vulnerabilities fixed this month were rated \u201ccritical\u201d by Microsoft, including eight remote code execution flaws.\n\nNotably absent from this month\u2019s patch batch is a fix for a newly discovered weakness in Windows Server 2025 that allows attackers to act with the privileges of any user in Active Directory. The bug, dubbed \u201cBadSuccessor,\u201d was publicly disclosed by researchers at Akamai on May 21, and several public proof-of-concepts are now available. Tenable\u2019s Satnam Narang said organizations that have at least one Windows Server 2025 domain controller should review permissions for principals and limit those permissions as much as possible.\n\nAdobe has released updates for Acrobat Reader and six other products addressing at least 259 vulnerabilities, most of them in an update for Experience Manager. Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome both recently released security updates that require a restart of the browser to take effect. The latest Chrome update fixes two zero-day exploits in the browser (CVE-2025-5419 and CVE-2025-4664).\n\nFor a detailed breakdown on the individual security updates released by Microsoft today, check out the Patch Tuesday roundup from the SANS Internet Storm Center. Action 1 has a breakdown of patches from Microsoft and a raft of other software vendors releasing fixes this month. As always, please back up your system and/or data before patching, and feel free to drop a note in the comments if you run into any problems applying these updates.",

        "content": "Welcome to Dark Reading's \"Career Conversations with a CISO\" video series, showcasing advice on breaking into and advancing within the cybersecurity field from those who have been there.\n\nIn this conversation with Dark Reading Associate Editor Kristina Beek, longtime CISO Melina Scotto shares her journey from aspiring opera singer to cybersecurity leader, having served as a top security head for federal contractors and Fortune 500 companies. Throughout her 30-year career, she witnessed cybersecurity transform from basic border protection to a comprehensive approach addressing lateral movement, AI-enabled threats, the cloud, and a range of different critical business risks that place cyber at the core of any successful enterprise.\n\nEmphasizing the importance of saying \"yes\" to new challenges and continuously learning, Scotto's recommendations for those entering the cybersecurity field include pursuing certifications through organizations like ISC2 and platforms like Udemy, and considering one's path before committing to full degree programs. Formal education remains valuable for leadership roles, but certifications may suffice for technical positions, especially for neurodivergent individuals with natural pattern recognition abilities.\n\nShe also advocates for gaining practical experience in different systems, networking, and AI before specializing in cybersecurity, as understanding the technical details helps security professionals work effectively with operations teams; and, seeking out mentors remains crucial for those just entering the field.\n\nRelated:Why Security Nudges Took Off\n\nPlease see below for the full video interview, followed by a transcript of the Q&A.\n\nThis transcript has been edited for clarity.\n\nKristina Beek: If you could just introduce yourself, and tell us about your background?\n\nMelina Scotto: I've been a CISO at companies that serve the federal government and federal contractors, as well as at the Fortune 500. Right now, my role is as an advisor to other CISOs and a board member to assist companies, and really thinking in the boardroom about cybersecurity like a CISO would.\n\nMy background is varied and colorful. I was supposed to be a famous opera singer by now, it always paid the bills (this is maybe 30 years ago) and paid for lessons. And so I really love to see artists go for a technical side-hustle, if you will.\n\nI learned very early on in my singing career that I couldn't get paid enough. Apparently I just didn't have what it what it took. But I loved database management, and the field was wide open at that time.\n\nRelated:Can Security Culture Be Taught? AWS Says Yes\n\nI went quickly from database management to one day the supervisor saying, well, you're now in charge of the network. And I said, okay.\n\nAnd then that quickly turned into managing firewalls. We didn't really call anything cybersecurity back then, it was more like border security. And then I did some HIPAA-type security for international health data, and then domestic health data and then federal health data.\n\n[We thought about] is it facing the public? Is it facing the Internet? That's the only thing we have to secure. But hey, wait a minute, it turns out that cybercriminals can make lateral movements, and so we really need to be securing everything. And that's when we started calling things cybersecurity.\n\nI was lucky enough to work with a big federal contractor. And one time when the federal government closed down, they said, you're an engineer. You can always write proposal language [and I ended up writing on cybersecurity].\n\nI thought it was fantasy writing, you know, I just thought it was so cool. They want rainbows and unicorns, and from a cybersecurity perspective, you design this solution for them, and you say, well, my unicorns are the most magical, and my rainbows are the most colorful, and if the fantasy that you submit is better than the other fantasies that all of your competition submits, you win.\n\nRelated:Women Who 'Hacked the Status Quo' Aim to Inspire Cybersecurity Careers\n\nThat's how I moved up in that organization and became CISO over their federal health sector, responsible for $3 billion worth of their work. We had maybe 300 contracts or so, and I had great mentors who were CISOs and CIOs above the entire organization of $12 billion, and they were just so generous.\n\nAfter that, I got the opportunity to work with the Fortune 500, which I enjoyed very much. It turns out we are all fighting the same cybercriminals.\n\nKB: What advice do you have for those looking to work their way up like that today?\n\nMS: I basically just always said yes to the next challenge, and what I would say to folks who are early in their career is just try it. Don't tell yourself that you're not the right fit. Try it and find out if you are. If you had told me at age 23 or 24 that I was going to be a VP and CISO, I would have thought you were mad. I just thought that wasn't for me. But you never know until you go into it.\n\nIt's been a fascinating ride. In terms of these 30 years, being in cybersecurity has been just an amazing journey, so much fun. There's been so much innovation.\n\nKB: What about the impact of AI on workforce opportunities? Where are you going to have the most opportunity for growth in an AI world?\n\nMS: I think you can combine the two for sure. You can't be thinking about cybersecurity and protecting your data and systems without thinking about AI, because cybercriminals are using it. We are in a cyber war, and it is going to take AI to defeat AI attacks. So there is an opportunity here to combine your AI education and certifications with your cybersecurity certifications.\n\nKB: Where can someone get started with certifications?\n\nMS: I'm a big certification advocate. I highly recommend that, especially if cybersecurity is your sideline, or you're not quite sure of it yet. Maybe you don't want to devote a four-year technical bachelor's degree to cyber, so try a certification class, see how you do. I love the boot camps.\n\nOr if you want to gain a little more knowledge, Dr. Lyron Andrews' courses on Udemy are incredible. He was one of my very first mentors and teachers for the ISC2 Certified Cloud Security Professional designation. He's wonderful. I would say ISC2 and Udemy are where I would start looking for certifications.\n\nHow do you know how you stack up against other engineers doing the same thing? You know your tech stack, and you're doing your due diligence and maybe even getting a certificate in the vendor tech that you're using, like Palo Alto or Cisco. But how do you compare with others? Getting national training and certification is really the way to go.\n\nI would say if folks are looking for a quick AI certificate right now, Oracle offers very good ones that you can get relatively quickly. Be prepared to put in 40 hours for some great, beautifully done training that's very inexpensive. It's free still until Oct. 1, but we've seen those dates come and go, and then they're extended a little bit more.\n\nKB: Is it a good idea to be well-rounded in your training, or specialize more?\n\nMS: Get a certification in AI, get a certification in cybersecurity, and see if that's where you want to go. Back when I was coming up, they didn't have degree programs in cybersecurity, so I got more of a network security degree for my Bachelor of Science.\n\nThe way that you got to a cybersecurity position or had cybersecurity in your job description was by making it through the ranks. Maybe you started with databases, or maybe you started at help desk, and then you graduated to the next level, and then there was this opportunity to be in cybersecurity. That was great because you needed to know all of those things.\n\nWhat am I asking somebody when I'm asking them to remediate this vulnerability? We can't just stand in our towers and say, \"Thou shalt remediate this right now,\" if we don't understand the level of effort and technical details required to actually remediate this vulnerability. Having all of that history in your background really helps you, because now I can say, \"Hey, let me download this for you. This should take you about 20 minutes,\" or whatever the case may be.\n\nI understand you from the perspective that I had your job before, and I understand what's on your plate, particularly for network people. It's about passing the packets. They would really like to do things securely. But if it's between operations being up and doing things securely, operations wins every time.\n\nSo really having that perspective in your career is important. Don't think that just because you have a cybersecurity degree right now that you should jump into cybersecurity and be successful. I would recommend starting in systems, or getting a little bit of training in systems, networking, or AI. Then when you become that CISO or cybersecurity professional, you're not just looking at it from an audit point of view or a checklist.\n\nYou really want to understand where the threats are coming from, understand the intelligence, understand what it's going to take in your environment to shore up any flaws and keep reducing that cyber risk.\n\nKB: Say we have an individual who is interested in going into cybersecurity, but they're not entirely sure. If they take those then decide this is something they want to pursue, would you recommend them getting a two-year or four-year degree, if this is something they want to pursue for the rest of their career? Does that help them stay competitive in this field? Or is that not something they absolutely need?\n\nMS: I think that the world has changed in the past 20 years or so when it comes to the value of four-year degrees, or even two-year degrees. I would say I had lofty goals in the beginning. I really did, but I didn't achieve my bachelor's degree until I was 45 years old, after a lot of studies.\n\nThat's just kind of my journey, and it depends on what's affordable for you, what makes sense for you. If you can get the certification and get the job and have your company pay for your Bachelor's or Associate's degree, fantastic. Especially if you see yourself as a CISO, if that's the goal, in a leadership position, then I would still say the world is as it always was: get some formal education.\n\nI have to say, I had years in my life where I thought, \"I don't need that. I'm doing the work.\" But the variety of things that I learned at an in-state university really rounded me out.\n\nKB: What if you want to be more of a front-line defender?\n\nMS: If you want to be an engineer or certainly a security operation center (SoC) analyst, you probably don't even need a degree if you have the certification, especially if you're neurodivergent. You can see stuff that [neurotypical] brains can't see, and are probably very good with pattern recognition and seeing indicators of compromise that other folks can't.\n\nIn that case, I would say traditional learning is probably not a friend, right? Because that's very straight-line thinking, like, here's the syllabus, here's when this assignment's due, here's when the test is. But a lot of our beautiful genius SOC people are thinking about wheels and spokes, you know what I mean? They can really see attacks from a different perspective.\n\nKB: Are there other paths into the cybersecurity industry that are worth flagging?\n\nMS: I would say also consider the military. You will get the benefit of having great experience, the additional benefit of security clearance, and also your veteran education, so that's always kind of great if you're not sure. I know it's a commitment to your country and such, but take that military aptitude test and see if you would be a good candidate for a SOC in a military installation.\n\nIn general, I think if you want a leadership role eventually along your journey, you can start out there, but know that your ceiling is going to lower over time if you don't break through it with some sort of degree.\n\nKB: If someone wants to find a mentor, how should they go about that?\n\nMS: I've gotten many of my mentees through LinkedIn, and friends and family, and I think you can certainly start with where you work, or maybe where you'd like to work, or if you're still in school, definitely get a job on campus in their IT department somewhere. They're all around you.\n\nOne of my first mentors, his name was Chad, and he was just so great. I mean, just always a positive coach in your corner, never an unkind word, and when I was wrong, and we're all wrong sometimes, he was very gentle and generous about correcting me. He was an IT manager from way back, and he tended to keep his people with him when he went from job to job. And I would keep that in the back of your mind \u2014 your mentor is going to know a lot about you, know about the value that you bring.\n\nAnd remember, it's not just a benefit for you as the mentee, but they will always have a person on their side that maybe if they need another contact or worker to be on their team, then you can fill that role.\n\nIt's also important to both have a mentor and be a mentor, so that you're closing that cycle.\n\nKB: When you were first going into cybersecurity, it was very different then than it is today. Would you say the changes are for better or for worse?\n\nMS: Oh, it's so much more razzle-dazzle now than it was. Back then we were these overseers of the network. We were nags. Nobody wanted cybersecurity. And often I observed this too, and I say this from a humble place, they would kick people over to cybersecurity if they didn't know what to do with them, because it was still emerging.\n\nNow, it's a very plum role to be on the cybersecurity team. You're not the have-nots in the IT manager's eyes or the CIO's eyes, you're really part of how they do business every day, how they bring value to the rest of their organization, not just kind of keeping the fat out of the fryer from a cybercriminal point of view, but it's a service. Cybersecurity is a service, and you have to do it well.\n\nTurns out, you can't just provide great controls \u2014 you have to help people understand what the controls are doing and how it furthers operations, how it makes them more competitive, how it adds to the bottom line. And that's really about relationship building.\n\nPeople understand now, in a way they didn't understand 20 years ago, that cyber risk is business risk. And before we had to stand on our soap boxes and say this is a really good thing to do, not just because we kind of have to do it from a regulatory perspective, but it turns out a well-patched system is not just more secure, but it's a better running system.\n\nKB: Because you're in a leadership position, what stands out to you in terms of personal qualities, characteristics of people you've managed, or maybe even people who have managed you? What makes them great at their job?\n\nMS: Let me start from the perspective of folks that have been my supervisors, and confidence and generosity of spirit is really what makes the greats great.\n\nEverybody's knowledgeable, and being super smart doesn't give you the right to be unkind to people. But some can be very hard and nasty to people [out of ego], or maybe they're covering their own behinds.\n\nIt sounds a little simple, but you want to love what you do and love the people that you're working with. I don't mean it in a weird way. It's just that mutual respect with them that you want.\n\nI would say what I look for in young talent is that spark in their eye. That's unlikely to be on their resume, right? Can you have a conversation with somebody? Can we connect? Are you curious about cybersecurity?\n\nI would much rather have that B+ student who's willing to put themselves out there, willing to try new things, willing to take a little bit of risk, than the A student who knows everything, and is not open to me teaching them anything. Confidence comes over time.\n\nSo I think being generous and humble works both up and down. Every exchange is an opportunity to build somebody up or to tear them down and make sure as both a leader and a participant that you're not cutting people down, but rather trying to build each other up.\n\nKB: What final words do you have for someone considering a cybersecurity career?\n\nMS: Let's see. I would say final words are, there are many paths that take you to cybersecurity, leadership you would like to do, and your path is all your own. Don't let anybody tell you that you're doing it the wrong way. And, there are plenty of good folks that want to help you succeed. Seek them out, and you'll find that path becomes a lot easier.",

        "link": "https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/fire-ant-cyber-spies-siloed-vmware-systems",
        "content": "A suspected Chinese nation-state threat group is conducting an extensive cyberespionage campaign that takes advantage of vulnerable VMware ESXi and vCenter environments.\n\nSince early 2025, researchers at Sygnia have responded to multiple incidents tied to a cyberespionage campaign they track as \"Fire Ant.\" According to research published Thursday, Fire Ant actors are establishing initial access in organizations' VMware systems, which have become popular targets for attackers in recent years.\n\nMore importantly, Fire Ant actors used deep knowledge of the target environments and strong capabilities to consistently bypass segmentations and reach isolated portions of the network.\n\n\"The threat actor leveraged combinations of sophisticated and stealthy techniques, creating multilayered attack kill chains to facilitate access to restricted and segmented network assets within presumed-to-be-isolated environments,\" the research team said in the blog post.\n\nFire Ant Hackers' Connections to UNC3886\n\nSygnia's investigation into the cyberespionage campaign found that Fire Ant actors exploited a nearly two-year-old vulnerability in VMware vCenter, tracked as CVE-2023-34048, to gain initial access to targeted organizations.\n\nCVE-2023-34048 was initially disclosed in October of 2023. However, several months later, Mandiant reported that the vulnerability had been exploited as a zero-day vulnerability for nearly two years prior to disclosure, by a China-nexus threat group tracked as UNC3886.\n\nRelated:Critical Infrastructure Security Is a Critical Concern\n\nSygina noted that Fire Ant's tools and targeting of VMware infrastructure \"strongly align with previous research on the threat group UNC3886,\" though the company said it does not engage in conclusive attribution. UNC3886 has been a thorn in the side of VMware customers in recent years.\n\nIn the Fire Ant campaign, actors used compromised vCenter instances to forge authentication cookies and retrieve service account credentials to access connected ESXi hosts with full administrative privileges. With control of the ESXi hosts, the attackers tampered with logs to obfuscate the threat activity and placed backdoors that persist after system reboots.\n\nAfter compromising the hypervisor, the Fire Ant actors exploited another vulnerability \u2014 CVE-2023-20867 \u2014 to execute commands inside the guest virtual machines (VMs) without the required authentication. CVE-2023-20867 is an authentication bypass flaw that was also exploited by UNC3886 and disclosed by Mandiant researchers in 2023.\n\nBy executing commands in the guest VMs, the attackers accessed virtual memory files to extract more credentials and use a custom executable to tamper with SentinelOne's endpoint detection and response (EDR) platform.\n\nRelated:Containment as a Core Security Strategy\n\nCyberattackers Break Down Network Barriers\n\nAfter achieving a full-stack compromise of the VMware environment, Fire Ant actors used organizations' network infrastructure to get around network segmentation and reach isolated environments. According to the researchers, the attackers exploited CVE-2022-1388, a critical F5 flaw that was first exploited in the wild in 2022, to compromise load balancers.\n\nThe Fire Ant actors then accessed internal Web servers and deployed network tunneling Web shells based on the open source project Neo-reGeorg, which created encrypted application-layer tunnels to additional parts of the victims' networks. Another trick used by the Fire Ant campaign involved using IPv6 to bypass filtering rules that were configured for IPv4, which Sygnia researchers called a \"common gap in dual-stack environments where IPv6 traffic is often left unmonitored and unfiltered.\"\n\nThe threat actors also used commands to enable port forwarding on servers and administrator workstations, which allowed them to reach restricted portions of the networks without running into firewall rules or segmentation controls.\n\nRelated:Nearly 2,000 MCP Servers Possess No Security Whatsoever\n\n\"By embedding tunnels within critical infrastructure, abusing trusted administrator paths, and exploiting gaps in enforcement, Fire Ant created multiple redundant bridges between isolated networks, allowing freedom of movement even under active response efforts,\" the research team said.\n\nSygnia researchers noted that the earliest detection they found came from a lone malicious process inside a guest VM, which triggered an alert. Once they investigated, they discovered the parent process from part of VMware Tools.\n\n\"This detail suggested the command had not been launched from within the guest, but rather injected from the host,\" they wrote in the blog post. \"This anomaly shifted the investigation toward the virtualization layer and led to the discovery of the broader campaign.\"\n\nSygnia's research team said the campaign highlights the need for organizations to harden their virtual environments, as many security products lack adequate visibility into assets like ESXi hosts. Sygnia urged organizations to patch their VMware vCenter and ESXi instances, assign unique, complex passwords for all ESXi root accounts and vCenter administrative users, and use a Privileged Identity Management (PIM) solution to rotate credentials and audit access.\n\nAdditionally, Sygnia recommended implementing additional segmentation for ESXi hosts by enforcing administrative interactions through vCenter and applying firewall rules to restrict vCenter access exclusively to designated assets. The company also recommended enabling Normal Lockdown Mode for ESXi hosts, which prevents direct SSH, HTTPS, and DCUI access.",

        "link": "https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/ai-generated-linux-miner-koske",
        "content": "A newly discovered cryptominer suggests that attackers are not only using artificial intelligence (AI) to develop malware from scratch but also to create code that exceeds the capabilities of human-generated malware.\n\nRecently, researchers from Aqua Nautilus caught a new Linux malware in a honeypot, which they named \"Koske.\" It's a cryptominer by trade, designed to identify the capabilities of the computer it infects, then run miners optimized to earn any one of 18 different cryptocurrencies, including Monero and Ravencoin.\n\nAccording to Assaf Morag, director of threat intelligence at Aqua Nautilus, running Koske through an AI detection tool revealed it to be essentially 100% AI-generated. Even a cursory review of its code made this conclusion obvious: There are AI-ish comments interspersed throughout, which explain what each part of the code does, and the structure of the code itself has a certain artificial je ne sais quoi.\n\nAnd while in 2025 AI malware is no longer so shocking, what stands out about Koske is that it also happens to be sophisticated \u2014 in some ways more sophisticated than all but the best human-written malware.\n\n\"It's startling to see that, as a defender,\" Morag says. \"If in the past there was a lot of broken code from script kiddies, we're starting to see better code, and they are going to succeed more now.\"\n\nRelated:Law Enforcement Cracks Down on XSS \u2014 but Will It Last?\n\nAI-Informed Initial Infection\n\nKoske appears to arrive in victim networks through misconfigurations in Internet-exposed servers; for example, Aqua Nautilus observed an attack exploiting a JupyterLab instance. To conceal its true nature, it's deployed from a website with a shortened URL.\n\nMore noticeably, the malware drops onto a system behind a smokescreen: AI-generated images of cute pandas. This isn't a case of steganography \u2014 rather, the malicious executable is appended at the end of the valid JPEG image to create a polyglot file. The images are meant less to serve a social engineering function than to bypass security software, which might not be likely to scan JPEGs for hidden malware in the same way they would if they spotted a raw executable file.\n\nSource: Aqua Nautilus\n\nEven by this point, before the malware begins to run, Morag sees the influence of AI. Though he can't be sure, because the delivery mechanism was so well thought out and lacks quirks or slip-ups common to human attackers, he says, \"I think that they used AI to plan the entire attack. It's frightening.\"\n\nHow Koske Works\n\nKoske uses layer upon layer of tricks to establish persistence and concealment in a target's system. It installs a rootkit, schedules cron jobs, and alters Linux startup files to ensure it starts upon any system reboot.\n\nRelated:Department of Education Site Mimicked in Phishing Scheme\n\nMost notable, perhaps, are the ways in which Koske doggedly forces a connection with its command-and-control (C2) infrastructure. It uses a few different tools to check for updates and commands and, if for some reason this process gets blocked, a human attacker need not step in. Instead, it will pursue a series of troubleshooting steps \u2014 resetting and changing proxy and domain name system (DNS) settings, erasing firewall rules, etc. If these steps fail, Koske will automatically scour the Web for lists of other possible proxy connections, then brute force until one of them allows it to reestablish contact with its home base.\n\n\"I haven't seen a lot of tools that do that before,\" Morag admits.\n\nWhile such a feature could, in principle, be written by a person, he says it would require the author to be a very excellent coder \u2014 at least in the past. \"You needed to know about a lot of resources and be able to figure out a way that, if you cannot download from location X, how you could use a proxy instead,\" he says. \"But with AI now, the bar is very low to be able to create this kind of code.\"\n\nMorag speaks from a place of personal experience. \"It's kind of difficult to create honeypots, because you're trying to create applications which are misconfigured or vulnerable by design. So before AI, I managed to create these kinds of applications, but it was more difficult. It would take two weeks. Now it takes me an hour, two hours,\" he says. In his estimation, then, \"based on my work with honeypots, I'd guess it took these attackers two hours, maybe three hours to perfect their code.\"\n\nRelated:What Makes Great Threat Intelligence?",

        "link": "https://www.darkreading.com/remote-workforce/north-korea-it-worker-rampage-doj",
        "content": "A \"laptop farmer\" in Arizona responsible for enabling North Korean IT worker infiltration into US companies is going to jail for eight and a half years, after raising $17 million in illicit funds for Kim Jong-Un\u2019s regime. That news, however, is merely a drop in the justice bucket, and DPRK's efforts to siphon salaries off of American companies is unlikely to wane anytime soon. So, US organizations need to wrap their heads around the magnitude of the threat.\n\nNorth Korea's multiyear HR-compromise effort has the twin goals of earning money for the hermit kingdom's nuclear program and other efforts via salaries, as well as gaining a foothold inside corporate networks for the purpose of planting cryptominers or malware for stealing secrets.\n\nTypically, applicants use well-crafted, carefully curated personae, complete with full social media profiles, AI-enhanced photos and deepfakes, and stolen identities to pass any background checks. Once hired, the freshly minted employees need accomplices inside the US to receive company-issued laptops and other equipment, which they can then remote-link to. That's where Christina Marie Chapman came in.\n\nChapman previously pleaded guilty to helping the DPRK place workers inside 309 US companies; the court sentenced her to 102 months in prison this week, and she was ordered to pay around $450,000 in judgments. She was the linchpin in a wider case involving multiple accomplices that shifted law enforcement's focus to unraveling the latticework of aiders and abettors that make the IT worker scheme possible.\n\nRelated:Dark Web Hackers Moonlight as Travel Agents\n\n\"Chapman operated a 'laptop farm' where she received and hosted computers from the U.S. companies at her home, deceiving the companies into believing that the work was being performed in the United States,\" according to an alert from the US Department of Justice. \"Chapman also shipped 49 laptops and other devices supplied by US companies to locations overseas, including multiple shipments to a city in China on the border with North Korea. More than 90 laptops were seized from Chapman's home following the execution of a search warrant in October 2023.\"\n\nLaptop farmers, it should be noted, are merely one aspect of the thriving IT worker ecosystem, as DTEX Systems laid out in a recent report.\n\n\"DPRK's cyber operations challenge the traditional nation-state playbook \u2014 merging cryptocurrency theft, espionage, and nuclear ambition within a self-funded system driven by profit, loyalty, and survival,\" said Sue Gordon, a member of DTEX\u2019s Advisory Board and former principal deputy director of US National Intelligence, in a statement. \"Recognizing it as a family-run mafia syndicate unblurs the lines between cybercrime and statecraft. This report pulls back the curtain on their inner workings and psychology, revealing how deeply embedded they already are within our workforce\u2014providing the context needed to anticipate their next move.\u201d\n\nRelated:Microsoft Rushes Emergency Patch for Actively Exploited SharePoint 'ToolShell' Bug\n\nSource: DTEX Systems\n\nVictimized companies run the gamut and include a major television network, banks, a Silicon Valley technology company, multiple Fortune 500 companies, an aerospace manufacturer, an automaker, a luxury retail store, and a US media and entertainment company, according to the DoJ.\n\n\"Remote workforces can be exploited as a soft underbelly of national cybersecurity,\" said Aaron Rose, security architect at Check Point, via email. \"Without effective identity verification and threat prevention, even the most secure organizations can be infiltrated.\"\n\nHe added, \"It\u2019s not just about fraud \u2014 this is digital espionage hiding in plain sight. When stolen identities enable adversaries to access our networks, we\u2019re no longer talking about data breaches \u2014 we\u2019re talking about breaches of national security. This is yet another example of how blurred the line has become between criminal activity and state-sponsored operations. Cybersecurity today is as much about protecting data as it is about protecting democracy.\"\n\nRelated:'PoisonSeed' FIDO Attack Turns Out to Be a Red Herring\n\nA 2024 United Nations report estimated that North Korean IT workers collectively generate $250 million to $600 million in revenue annually. Individual workers can earn an average of $300,000 per year, but workers get to keep less than 20% of their wages \u2014 meaning that the regime is pocketing a nice chunk of change.\n\nThis cyber corps is expanding, too: South Korea's National Intelligence Service reported last year that the number of people working in North Korea's cyber division has double-digit growth, ballooning from 6,800 in 2022 to 8,400 in 2024. Fake IT workers specifically number as many as 4,000, according to the UN.\n\nAll of those resources are translating to a volume of onslaught that warrants immediate action. Security vendor SentinelOne, for instance, reported in April that it has \"tracked roughly 360 fake personae and more than 1,000 job applications linked to DPRK IT worker operations applying for roles at SentinelOne \u2014 even including brazen attempts to secure positions on the SentinelLabs intelligence engineering team itself.\"\n\nNorth Korea Scheme Accomplice Awaits Sentencing\n\nChapman and a Ukrainian co-conspirator Oleksandr Didenko were charged in May 2024 with aggravated identity theft, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and conspiracy to commit money laundering, wire fraud, identity fraud, and bank fraud.\n\nDidenko is awaiting sentencing, but he faces a maximum penalty of 67.5 years in prison. He has been convicted of running a website, upworksell.com, which offered full-service false identity creation. Services included US account creation, SIM card rentals for mobile phones, money transfers, and more.\n\n\"Didenko allegedly offered a full array of services to allow an individual to pose under a false identity and market themselves for remote IT work with unsuspecting companies,\" according to the indictment announcement last year. \"Didenko is alleged to have managed as many as approximately 871 \u2018proxy\u2019 identities, provided proxy accounts for three freelance US IT hiring platforms, and provided proxy accounts for three different US-based money service transmitters \u2026 [and] facilitated the operation of at least three US-based laptop farms, at one point hosting approximately 79 computers.\"\n\nOther co-conspirators remain at large, including three foreign nationals listed by aliases by the DoJ: Jiho Han, Haoran Xu, and Chunji Jin.\n\n\"It's not surprising that we're seeing North Korean threat actors continue to use identity theft as a tool for sanctions evasion,\" says Jake Williams, former US National Security Agency (NSA) hacker, IANS Research faculty and vice president of R&D at Hunter Strategy. \"This underscores the need for organizations to engage in robust identity verification for new hires, including detailed background checks. Security teams need to be aware that if they see something odd, it needs to be investigated, doubly so for new hires and IT workers.\"\n\nHow US Companies Can Avoid Hiring North Koreans\n\nThe Chapman news is the latest in a string of DoJ arrests and announcements regarding DPRK facilitators inside the US. However, law-enforcement scrutiny or not, the efforts are likely to continue, so American businesses need to stay on high alert.\n\nChart by Dark Reading, based on DoJ security suggestions.\n\n\u201cAs DPRK becomes more sophisticated in its methods, the need for 'laptop farms' will likely disappear,\" warns Joshua McKenty, former chief cloud architect at NASA and CEO of Polyguard. \"This is just the beginning. Employers aren't ready \u2014 the AI-modified identity documents the North Koreans are using will pass their casual background checks.\"\n\nThe business risk can be somewhat mitigated by adopting advanced identity verification tools, too, which can provide proof of location using GPS and GSM data, and other presence guarantees that prevent the use of remote desktop logins, he notes.\n\n\"While 'following the money' remains a standard approach to tracking down these crimes, broader identity verification initiatives that are also tackling so-called 'co-employment' and other forms of identity fraud among employees, including 'proxy candidates,' are likely to benefit,\" McKenty explains. \"Standard background checks are not catching these crimes, thanks to next-generation 'hybrid' document fraud, which takes advantage of deepfake technology.\"",

        "title": "Why Security Nudges Took Off",
        "link": "https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/why-security-nudges-took-off",
        "content": "COMMENTARY\n\nThe appeal of nudging \u2014 that is, guiding users in the right direction \u2014 is clear: It meets users where they are. A timely reminder before accessing sensitive data, a pop-up when risky behavior is detected, a contextual security tip at login, a security issue about to reach its remediation deadline \u2014 these are all common examples.\n\nDone well, nudges can improve security awareness and encourage better behavior without blocking productivity. They offer a more human-centered alternative to strict enforcement or reactive controls.\n\nBut there's a crucial question every security team should be asking: Have we crossed the line from helpful prompting into frustrating noise?\n\nWhy Does Nudging Stop Working?\n\n1. Nudge Fatigue\n\nWhen nudges are overused \u2014 especially across multiple channels or teams \u2014 they can blend into the background. Just like too many browser pop-ups, they become easy to dismiss. Repetition without relevance leads to disengagement.\n\n2. Emotional Friction\n\nWe often forget that nudges carry tone and timing \u2014 both of which affect how they're received. A friendly \"You might want to update this\" message may feel supportive to one person but tone-deaf to another under pressure.\n\nThe impact is even more pronounced when nudges are tied to tight deadlines or high-stakes deliverables. What was intended as a nudge can be experienced as judgment.\n\nRelated:Cyber Career Opportunities: Weighing Certifications vs. Degrees\n\n3. One Size Doesn't Fit All\n\nBehavioral design isn't universal. The same nudge that works for a marketing team might fall flat for developers or finance leads. Job functions, team cultures, and day-to-day realities shape how nudges land.\n\nYet many organizations deploy nudges uniformly \u2014 without tailoring language, frequency, or channel. This not only reduces effectiveness but can create unintended friction.\n\n4. Poor Timing or Context\n\nEven well-crafted nudges can miss the mark if delivered at the wrong time. Interruptions during peak work hours, alerts with little context, or messages that feel disconnected from immediate tasks can lead to annoyance rather than action.\n\nHow to Know When Your Nudges No Longer Work\n\nWhile most teams track click-throughs or completion rates, those stats alone don't paint the full picture. Consider these broader signs:\n\nEngagement drop-offs over time, even with increased outreach\n\nRemediation delays, especially on items tied to frequent nudges\n\nEscalating exception requests or workarounds\n\nConsistent business pushback to security prompts or training asks\n\nEach of these can signal that what was once an effective behavior-change strategy is now contributing to fatigue or resistance.\n\nRelated:Can Security Culture Be Taught? AWS Says Yes\n\nMoving Forward: Smarter Nudging, Not More Nudging\n\nThe goal isn't to stop nudging \u2014 it's to do it better. Nudges should be intentional, tested, and adaptive. Here are practical ways to strengthen your behavioral design strategy:\n\nEmpower, don't shame: Avoid guilt-inducing messaging. Focus on enabling secure choices, not pointing out mistakes.\n\nDesign defaults over reminders: Where possible, build security into the workflow. The best nudge is often no nudge \u2014 it's a default behavior that's already secure.\n\nTest before scaling: Pilot nudges with your own team or a partner group. Get qualitative feedback on tone, clarity, and timing. You'll often learn more from five honest reactions than from a dashboard of metrics.\n\nContextualize and customize: Tailor nudges to the audience. Developers need different language and timing than business users. When relevance goes up, so does engagement.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nNudges can be powerful \u2014 but they are not immune to overuse or misapplication. As security professionals, we must challenge ourselves to go beyond check-the-box behavior design. Nudging should spark attention, not irritation. Influence, not interference.\n\nIf we want to build a security-first culture, we can't just prompt \u2014 we have to listen, adapt, and evolve.\n\nRelated:Women Who 'Hacked the Status Quo' Aim to Inspire Cybersecurity Careers",

        "link": "https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/young-cybercriminals-raise-concerns",
        "content": "Cybercriminal groups are attracting a significant number of tech-savvy minors, lured by money, a sense of community, or scoring online fame with little concern for the risks of prosecution, government and private-sector experts warn.\n\nIn a July 23 alert, the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) noted that one growing group, Hacker Com, has attracted a wide variety of English-speaking minors to \"a broad community of technically sophisticated cyber criminals.\" In early July, the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) arrested four people \u2014 a 20-year-old woman, two 19-year-old males, and a 17-year-old male \u2014 in connection with the cyberattacks against and disruption of two retailers, Marks & Spencer and the Co-op.\n\nMore young people are joining groups online \u2014 either connected to gaming or other communities \u2014 and crossing into criminality, says Rebecca Taylor, a manager with the Counter Threat Unit at cybersecurity firm Sophos.\n\n\"It's a very thin line,\" she says. \"As an example, the crossover between gaming forums, and other channels and conversations where cybercrime takes place, is an easy line to cross.\"\n\nThe growth in youth participation in cybercriminal groups is not likely an organic phenomenon but part of a larger global trend toward recruiting young people to strengthen cybercriminal groups, experts say. In South Africa, street gangs target kids as young as 12, while all-female gangs in Malaysia recruit school girls as young as 13, according to a report published by the European Parliament in June.\n\nRelated:Translating Cyber-Risk for the Boardroom\n\nIn Europe, cybercriminal networks are actively targeting young people, often in connection with the sale and distribution of recreational drugs, the report stated.\n\n\"The phenomenon of recruitment of minors into organized crime \u2014 with minors being, willingly or forcibly, drawn into illegal activities \u2014 is concerning,\" the report stated. \"Recruited minors are reportedly involved in more than 70% of illegal market activities and engage in a wide range of illicit activities \u2014 from drug production and trafficking to cybercrime, migrant smuggling, trafficking in human beings, and various forms of financial fraud.\"\n\nFrom Game Raids to Ransomware\n\nFor cybercrime, recruiters can easily target teenagers by focusing on popular games, especially forums where members are already committing acts that fall into legal gray areas, says Sophos' Taylor. Some early player forums morphed into cybercriminal hubs in later years, she says.\n\n\"What began as a space for disruptive online behavior, such as 'raids,' doxxing, and credential leaks, quickly changed into a hub for trading breached databases, cracked accounts, and other illicit data \u2014 structured cybercriminal activity,\" Taylor says. \"This is where individuals who joined with one intention were exposed and potentially switched to another.\"\n\nRelated:Banking Trojan Coyote Abuses Windows UI Automation\n\nAn investigation of the ecosystem of money mules uncovered that recruitment does not just occur online, but in person at school and in neighborhoods, according to Luuk Bekkers, a postdoctoral researcher at the Hague University of Applied Sciences and the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement (NSCR). Bekkers investigated money mules and associated financial crimes for his doctoral thesis and found that social media plays a significant role.\n\n\"What greatly influences the origin and growth of criminal networks nowadays is social media,\" he says. \"Criminals exploit technological developments to improve parts of the crime script, including the recruitment of co-offenders. Social media in particular provides access to a very large target group of potential new recruits.\"\n\nWhile recruitment activities do play a role, many of the groups bolstered their ranks less from targeting susceptible youths and more by grouping with like-minded peers, argues Sophos' Taylor. Teen cybercrime gangs \u2014 and even suspects in recent arrests, such Kai West, known as \"IntelBroker,\" members of the ShinyHunters group, and those believed to be responsible for the Marks & Spencer attacks \u2014 are all relatively young individuals but have been present in underground forums and committing cybercrime for a while, she says.\n\nRelated:Why ISO 42001 Matters for AI Governance at Scale\n\n\"These are individuals who have learned their tradecraft and worked their way up in the victim stakes, from small data leaks right the way up to large retail attacks,\" Taylor says. \"As part of this, they have found their communities, identified their groups and like-minded people or 'friends,' and supported each other in their malicious behaviors. It is not necessarily recruitment; it can be as simple as being in connected communities.\"\n\nCan Diversion Pay Dividends?\n\nThe luring of minors into online crimes is not limited to cybercrimes. The FBI continues to investigate a cult-like group, known as \"764,\" that targets minors, aiming to convince them to do increasingly violent and sexual acts. In April, the US Department of Justice announced the arrest and charging of two leaders of 764 \u2014 one in Greece and the other in North Carolina \u2014 designating the group as a nihilistic violent extremist (NVE) network.\n\nFinding ways to divert minors from potential illegal activity \u2014 or reinforcing the risks and consequences if they are caught \u2014 is critical, but governments should also work to make their communities more resilient. In West and Central Africa, schools teach cybersecurity skills to students with a secondary aim of diverting them from joining gangs and militias.\n\nIn addition to ethical skills, schools and peer groups should educate young hackers about the risks they take if they venture into cybercrime. While cybercriminals are less likely to be caught, compared with other types of criminal offenders, certain offenses \u2014 such as money mules \u2014 tend to have a high risk of prosecution.\n\nYet even in those cases, offenders tend to perceive less risk, Hague University's Bekkers says.\n\n\"I think it is good that young people are taught digital ethics and pro-social applications of skills from an early age, [but] many cybercrimes do not require much skill, especially [those] concerning online fraud,\" he adds. \"Social media offers possibilities to reach cybercriminals for intervention purposes [such as] messages meant to increase risk perception and to discourage criminal behaviors.\"",

        "content": "Too many organizations lack what experts describe as a \"strong security culture,\" which leaves them extremely vulnerable to repeated attacks and unacceptable risks. But can a security culture be built from scratch?\n\nSecurity culture is broadly defined as an organization's shared strategies, policies, and perspectives that serve as the foundation for its enterprise security program. For many years, infosec leaders have preached the importance of a strong culture and how it cannot only strengthen the organization's security posture but also spur increases in productivity and profitability.\n\nSecurity culture has also been a focus in the aftermath of last year's scathing Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) report on Microsoft, which stemmed from an investigation into a high-profile breach of the software giant at the hands of the Chinese nation-state threat group Storm-0558. The CSRB found \"Microsoft's security culture was inadequate and requires an overhaul,\" according to the April 2024 report. Specifically, the CSRB board members flagged an overall corporate culture at Microsoft that \"deprioritized both enterprise security investments and rigorous risk management.\"\n\nPerhaps not coincidentally, a few months later AWS made security culture the focus of its re:Inforce 2024 conference. The cloud giant highlighted structural aspects, including the AWS Security Guardians program, which embeds a leader within each service development team to promote best practices and more effectively scale security processes. Newly appointed AWS CISO Amy Herzog spoke with Dark Reading at this year's re:Inforce 2025 conference about the importance of security culture and what core ingredients organizations need to build a strong one.\n\nRelated:Women Who 'Hacked the Status Quo' Aim to Inspire Cybersecurity Careers\n\nCulture Starts at the Top\n\nOne of the most frequently cited aspects of Amazon's security culture is the leadership team, specifically the reporting structure for key executives. Herzog says the direct reporting relationship between Amazon CSO Steve Schmidt and president and CEO Andy Jassy has been key to the company's security culture, and it's a big part of why she believes that culture can be replicated at AWS customers.\n\nPrior to being appointed as AWS CISO this spring, Herzog served for more than two years as CISO of Amazon's Ads & Devices and Specialized Business divisions. During that time, she worked closely with various customer organizations and observed the effectiveness of such executive reporting structures and leadership.\n\n\"I saw it play out in my smaller businesses over the last two years,\" she says. \"And there are differences between those businesses and AWS. But I would characterize those differences as ones that are necessary implications of the products being different.\"\n\nRelated:Ransomware Reshaped How Cyber Insurers Perform Security Assessments\n\nBut security culture goes beyond frameworks and executive structures; Herzog says leaders need to have the right philosophies and approaches to create an effective, productive environment for employees throughout the organization, not just those on the security team.\n\nAccording to ISACA's \"2024 State of Cybersecurity\" report, two-thirds of infosec professionals say their jobs are more stressful today than they were five years ago. The report, which surveyed 1,800 infosec professionals worldwide, also found that a majority of respondents were grappling with underfunded budgets (51%) and understaffed teams (57%).\n\nSimple shifts in how leadership teams communicate with employees can produce positive benefits \u2014 as well as negative ones, Herzog says.\n\n\"If you're a business leader and there's been an issue, and you're talking to your security team, one approach is to ask, 'How could you have let this happen?'\" Herzog says. \"And that drives a particular kind of behavior.\"\n\nThat blame-game approach can lead to even higher stress, lower morale, and lack of confidence in the organization's mission, all of which can present greater obstacles for staff retention \u2014 already a challenge for many organizations, according to ISC2's \"2023 Cybersecurity Workforce Study.\" Herzog suggests a better approach.\n\nRelated:The Triple Threat of Burnout: Overworked, Unsatisfied, Trapped\n\n\"The other question to ask, which is what we use in our internal process, is, 'How were the systems constructed in such a way that made this a possibility?'\" she says. \"The question is, 'What did we not do together as a team that let this possibility exist?' And that drives a different set of behaviors.\"\n\nRedefining Success\n\nA big reason why a security culture is hard to build, according to Herzog, is that many organizations are simply defining success incorrectly.\n\n\"If success for the business team is 'ship this quarter, we actually don't care what happens next quarter,' then you're not going to get the right outcomes,\" she says.\n\nInstead, organizations need to take the longer view and understand that security is integral to long-term success. The good news is security isn't the roadblock for developers that it used to be, according to Herzog. The \"inside-the-box thinking\" of the past, where stopping the development process to check everything was the norm, has given way to a new approach.\n\n\"The adjustment of software development from this requirements-up-front waterfall approach to the continuous iteration approach is probably at the heart of what's got me optimistic,\" Herzog says. \"And I think the security community is really ready to understand that power and leverage it.\"\n\nProduct development still has its challenges. For example, long-term credentials pose significant risks to organizations, and they're commonly used by developers, Herzog says. Therefore, the task for security teams is to make short-term, temporary credentials easier for development teams to use.\n\nDespite those obstacles, Herzog believes the technology industry is in a \"meaningfully different place\" today in terms of being able to build secure products and services at scale. Although customer organizations in other verticals will have different product development processes, Herzog believes the same lessons will apply.\n\n\"That kind of cultural playbook \u2014 we are all here to serve the customer, we know the customer has expectations, and we need to earn and keep their trust, here is the product we're building, here's what it looks like, and here's how we're going to build it together \u2014 is what I saw happen across my other businesses, so I'm quite optimistic,\" she says.",

        "content": "UPDATE\n\nLaw enforcement notched a significant victory against the cybercrime economy this week with the takedown of the notorious forum XSS and the arrest of its suspected administrator.\n\nEuropol said on Wednesday that authorities in Ukraine arrested an unnamed individual suspected of running XSS, which the agency called \"one of the world's most influential Russian-speaking cybercrime platforms.\" A short time later, the domain \u2014 XSS.is \u2014 was seized by French authorities and taken down. The law enforcement operation is the latest high-profile action against cybercrime forums and their alleged operators this year.\n\nAccording to Europol, the unnamed suspect was arrested on July 22 in Kyiv, Ukraine. The arrest was part of a coordinated law enforcement operation, led by French police and the Paris public prosecutor's office, with support from Ukraine authorities and Europol.\n\nNews of the arrest and takedown made waves across the infosec community. SOCRadar chief information security officer (CISO) Ensar Seker says the law enforcement actions mark a \"pivotal moment\" against the larger cybercrime ecosystem.\n\n\"XSS wasn't just another Dark Web marketplace, it was the most influential Russian-language cybercrime forum for the past several years,\" Seker says. \"It served as a critical hub for high-tier actors, including ransomware affiliates, initial access brokers, malware developers, and money laundering enablers. In fact, many of the most prominent [ransomware-as-a-service] groups either recruited or transacted through XSS.\"\n\nRelated:AI-Generated Linux Miner 'Koske' Beats Human Malware\n\nXV Underground, an online repository that collects malware samples and security research, said in a post on social media platform X yesterday that the arrest could potentially be \"a massive blow to the [Commonwealth of Independent States] cybercrime ecosystem.\"\n\nJohn Hammond, principal security research at Huntress, notes that both the forum's clearnet and dark web domains have been taken down. \"XSS has historically been one of the largest cybercrime forums so this will be a big hit to that illicit industry,\" he says.\n\nXSS Marks the Spot?\n\nThe origins of XSS go back to at least 2013 when the Russian-speaking cybercrime forum was known as DamageLab. In late 2017, authorities in Belarus arrested an administrator of the site, Sergey \"Ar3s\" Yarets, who was released from prison less than a year later after cooperating with authorities.\n\nDuring that time, the forum was relaunched as XSS, apparently in reference to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Over the past eight years, XSS grew to be one of the most active and popular marketplaces in the cybercriminal underworld. SOCRadar rated XSS as the number one Dark Web cybercrime forum in the world and called it \"a bustling hacker forum where discussions revolve around unauthorized access sales, malware, security vulnerabilities, and database trading.\"\n\nRelated:Department of Education Site Mimicked in Phishing Scheme\n\nEuropol noted that the forum had more than 50,000 registered users and served as a central hub for many of the most infamous cybercrime operations and ransomware gangs to recruit members, plot attacks, and advertise their offerings.\n\nMany cybercrime forums and Dark Web marketplaces have been taken down by authorities in recent years, only to spring back up soon after. But the arrest of the suspected administrator could make the law enforcement action much more impactful.\n\n\"What made XSS stand out wasn't just volume but trust,\" Seker says. \"It maintained tight vetting processes, an active mod team, escrow services, and a reputation system that facilitated everything from infostealer logs to zero-day trades.\"\n\nThe arrest of the XSS administrator opens the possibility of history repeating itself; if the unnamed suspect cooperates with authorities, like Yarets reportedly did years ago, it could not only destroy the trust within the XSS community but also spark more investigations, charges, and even arrests.\n\nRelated:What Makes Great Threat Intelligence?\n\nFor now, the law enforcement actions eliminate a key resource for cybercriminals, which could have a major impact given the forum's stature as a go-to destination, Hammond says. \" This one does stick out to me, because XSS is just so infamous and well-known as one of the most established cybercrime forums,\" he says. \"I think this takedown and arrest really is taking a big chunk out of the online cybercrime ecosystem.\"\n\nSeker agrees the takedown of the site will at least temporarily eliminate a key point of coordination for cybercriminals. But he notes that takedowns of similar forums have proved short-lived, and threat actors often move to new platforms or decentralized alternatives, such as Telegram channels. Therefore, while law enforcement actions are important, he says they're unlikely to diminish the overall threat landscape in the long term.\n\nSimilarly, Intel 471's Adversary Intelligence Team says it's too early to determine the full effect of the law enforcement actions and notes that it's possible XSS members may move to other forums to \"avoid further scrutiny.\"\n\n\"The Duty-Free and RAMP forums are possible candidates to attract actors seeking a new primary forum to conduct operations,\" the team says in a statement to Dark Reading.\n\nMore Legal Actions\n\nThe operation against XSS wasn't the only legal action of note in the past week. On Tuesday, five individuals were sentenced to prison terms for operating Jetflicks, one of the largest illegal television streaming services in the US, according to the Department of Justice (DOJ). The service's ringleader, Kristopher Lee Dallmann, was sentenced to eight years in prison.\n\nThe DOJ said Dallmann made millions in profit from the illegal streaming service, with the government \"conservatively\" estimating the copyright infringement costs at $37.5 million.\n\nLast Thursday, Google revealed it had filed a lawsuit against the perpetrators of BADBOX 2.0, a massive botnet compromised of more than 10 million uncertified devices running Android's open source software. Because these uncertified devices are running the open source version of Android (Android Open Source Project), they lack the security protections included in Google's commercial version and therefore make easy prey for threat actors to undertake malicious activity like botnets.\n\nHowever, Google is fighting back. The lawsuit alleges that several unnamed cybercriminals in China are operating the largest known botnet of Internet-connected TV devices. \"It has harmed millions of victims in the United States and around the world and threatens many more,\" the complaint stated. \"Without warning, it could be used to commit more dangerous cybercrimes, such as ransomware or distributed denial-of-service ('DDoS') attacks.\"\n\nThis story was updated at 8:00 a.m. ET on July 25 to reflect comments from Huntress.",

        "content": "China-based threat actor Storm-2603 has been observed attacking on-premises SharePoint customers with Warlock ransomware.\n\nThat comes from Microsoft, which on June 23 updated a blog post published the day before, detailing how three state-backed actors \u2014 Linen Typhoon, Violet Typhoon, and Storm-2603 \u2014 are targeting on-premises SharePoint customers using two vulnerabilities, spoofing flaw CVE-2025-49706 and remote code execution bug CVE-2025-49704, as well as related flaws CVE-2025-53770 and CVE-2025-53771. The vulnerabilities were discovered by a Viettel Cyber Security researcher, who leveraged an attack chain dubbed \"ToolShell\" to show how the flaws could be exploited.\n\nMicrosoft disclosed earlier this month that the vulnerabilities were under exploitation, and over the following days, certain customers, such as the US Nuclear Weapons Agency, have reported experiencing an attack.\n\nThe vulnerabilities affect SharePoint Server Subscription, 2019, and 2016, and Microsoft has issued patches to address these issues. The vulnerabilities do not affect SharePoint Online in Microsoft 365. \"Customers should apply these updates immediately to ensure they are protected,\" Microsoft said.\n\nThe June 23 update to its June 22 blog post detailed how Storm-2603 is deploying Warlock ransomware.\n\nRelated:Fixed Ivanti Bugs Still Haunt Japan Orgs 6 Months Later\n\nWarlock Attacks\n\nAccording to Microsoft, Storm-2603 was observed deploying ransomware in recent days. Although that's not unusual for a Chinese threat actor, it is notable during a campaign where threat actors are attempting to conduct espionage (Violet Typhoon) and steal state-owned intellectual property (Linen Typhoon).\n\nBy contrast, although Storm-2603 has been observed deploying LockBit and Warlock ransomware, Microsoft said in its blog that the company is \"currently unable to confidently assess the threat actor's objectives.\"\n\nRansomware, when not deployed for destructive reasons (as seen during Russia's invasion of Ukraine), is typically a tool for financially motivated attackers.\n\nWhat Microsoft said in its blog post is that Storm-2603 was spotted deploying Warlock ransomware on July 18, and that, separately, \"Microsoft tracks this threat actor in association with attempts to steal MachineKeys using the on-premises SharePoint vulnerabilities.\"\n\nThe actor has been seen gaining initial access through the aforementioned vulnerabilities; using discovery commands to enumerate user context and validate privilege levels; creating scheduled tasks and manipulating Internet Information Services (IIS) components to gain persistence; gaining credentials via Mimikatz; and moving laterally through additional commands. Finally, \"Storm-2603 is then observed modifying Group Policy Objects (GPO) to distribute Warlock ransomware in compromised environments,\" Microsoft said in the blog post.\n\nRelated:Lumma Stealer Is Back & Stealthier Than Ever\n\nThe company added, \"Additional actors will continue to use these exploits to target unpatched on-premises SharePoint systems, further emphasizing the need for organizations to implement mitigations and security updates immediately.\"\n\nDark Reading contacted Microsoft for more information, but a spokesperson for the company declined to provide further comment.\n\nWhat Defenders Can Do\n\nMicrosoft's blog post includes indicators of compromise as well as substantial mitigation guidance.\n\nIn addition to applying relevant security updates, Microsoft recommends customers deploy capable endpoint protection, rotate SharePoint Server ASP.NET machine keys, restart IIS on all SharePoint servers using iisreset.exe, and implement an incident response plan. The blog post also includes recommendations specifically for Microsoft Defender users.\n\nIf there's one takeaway here, it's that this exploitation seems to be just ramping up.\n\n\"Investigations into other actors also using these exploits are still ongoing,\" Microsoft's post read. \"With the rapid adoption of these exploits, Microsoft assesses with high confidence that threat actors will continue to integrate them into their attacks against unpatched on-premises SharePoint systems.\"\n\nRelated:Printer Security Gaps: A Broad, Leafy Avenue to Compromise",

        "link": "https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/translating-cyber-risk-boardroom",
        "content": "COMMENTARY\n\nCybersecurity is no longer just a technical problem in today's fast-evolving threat landscape, where cyberattacks are growing more frequent, sophisticated, and publicly damaging. Instead, it's an issue that demands enterprisewide alignment.\n\nYet, many chief information security officers (CISOs) still find themselves speaking a technical language that fails to resonate with other leaders. Technical terms often fall flat in boardrooms more concerned with revenue growth and brand reputation. This disconnect is becoming increasingly risky as cyber incidents now directly affect stock prices, customer trust, and executive job security. Plus, boards are being held accountable and personally liable for cyber-risks. CISOs can no longer afford to communicate in technical silos; they must create strategic partners, clearly connecting cybersecurity to business outcomes and informing board members of their fiduciary responsibilities.\n\nWhy Cyber-Risk Doesn't Always Land\n\nDespite growing awareness, many executive teams still struggle to understand the business relevance of technical threats. When CISOs present detailed threat matrices, patching schedules, or vulnerability scans to the board, they risk overwhelming non-technical stakeholders and losing their influence.\n\nRelated:The Young and the Restless: Young Cybercriminals Raise Concerns\n\nWithout connecting risk to a potential business disruption, such as delayed customer transactions or compliance penalties, the message gets lost altogether. This was a pain point echoed by security leaders across industries at 2025's RSAC Conference \u2014 technical expertise isn't enough anymore. As security leaders, we are expected to clearly articulate business impact, influence culture, and align security strategy with enterprise goals.\n\nBuilding A Culture of Shared Responsibility\n\nCyber-risk should not be seen as an isolated IT problem \u2014 it's a shared responsibility across the enterprise. For example, finance needs to understand the return on investment (ROI) of security investments; HR must align on secure onboarding and offboarding practices; legal must collaborate on incident response and regulatory readiness.\n\nSoft skills are essential here \u2014 security leaders should practice active listening, empathy, and persuasive storytelling when communicating with other leaders. Whether an employee is at the front desk or in the boardroom, they should understand how their actions affect security, becoming allies rather than liabilities.\n\nTo truly transform the workforce into a first line of defense, security must be woven into the very fabric of organizational culture. This means moving beyond compliance and fostering an environment where every employee understands their responsibility in the broader security strategy. The key is to create a culture of security where employees don't just learn about risks but are motivated to take ownership of their role in preventing them.\n\nRelated:Banking Trojan Coyote Abuses Windows UI Automation\n\nAs a security leader, now is the time to be proactive in upleveling the conversation around security culture and metrics. Working with global brands across industries, several boards ask for metrics beyond compliance and click rates that demonstrate progress and strength of an organization's security culture and human attack surface.\n\nSpeaking the Language of the Board\n\nTo drive strategic alignment, CISOs must reposition cybersecurity as a business enabler \u2014 not just a cost center. This will make it easier to embed security into other organizational initiatives like digital transformation, cloud migration, and product innovation, and not just bolt it on afterward.\n\nCISOs can gain credibility and influence by:\n\nParticipating in strategic planning and budget discussions\n\nFraming security projects as drivers of risk reduction and competitive advantage\n\nDeveloping clear business cases for investments in technologies like zero trust, data loss prevention, or incident response automation\n\nRelated:Why ISO 42001 Matters for AI Governance at Scale\n\nWhen CISOs demonstrate how security reduces risk while enabling speed and scale, they earn a stronger voice at the decision-making table. Meanwhile, when presenting to the board specifically, clarity is everything. Board members don't need to understand every technical detail. Rather, they need to know what it means for the business.\n\nAt the end of the day, the board is seeking confidence that management is appropriately mitigating cybersecurity risks to protect the company from loss. Effective board communication should focus on the following:\n\nLikelihood and impact: Frame risks in terms of probability and business consequence.\n\nTrends over time: Use dashboards to show progress and areas of concern.\n\nPlain language: Avoid jargon; use analogies or narratives to explain complex threats.\n\nStrategic alignment: Tie security efforts to business priorities like customer trust, compliance, or growth.\n\nRisk journeys: Provide an update on the current threat landscape industry wide, showing the state of current risk inside and outside of your enterprise.\n\nClear metrics: Viewer friendly, qualitative and quantitative data points, providing information and insights.\n\nWhatever the method, the goal is the same: inspire informed decision-making and reinforce security as a strategic asset.\n\nEarning a Seat at the Table\n\nThe most successful CISOs are not just technologists; they are translators, collaborators, and strategists. By framing cybersecurity in terms of business value, they make the abstract concrete and the technical relevant. They connect the dots between threat intelligence and corporate resilience, as well as between compliance and culture.\n\nThe key lies not in speaking louder, but in speaking the right language. Cyber-risk is business risk. When security leaders embrace this truth and learn to speak in the language of leadership, they don't just protect the enterprise, they help lead it forward, which is exactly what the rest of the C-suite wants to see.",
